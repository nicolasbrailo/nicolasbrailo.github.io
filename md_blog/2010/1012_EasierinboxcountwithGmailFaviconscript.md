There's a very cool script to add to your browser but first:

* Do you try to keep your inbox count in 0 (but usually fail miserably)?
* Do you like (need!) to be notified when a new mail arrives?
* Do you like Opera?

If you meet this conditions then you are very sick and need professional help. In the meantime, go and check [Gmail Favicon Alerts 3](md_blog/youfoundadeadlink.md), a cool script which changes gmails favicon to show your current email count. It works on Opera but it makes it crash. Most likely the script is [not the one](md_blog/2010/0708_Operaborksgmail.md) [to blame](md_blog/2010/0723_FuuuuuuuuuuuuuuOpera.md) here...
