True, so true... It's been said a thousand times, but I kinda like ranting... like it or not Office files are a majority out there. If you work with Linux, using it in a real enterprise environment, sooner or later you'll run into someone using a propietary Office format. You'll also run into someone who doesn't know that you need OOO to open those weird odf files. You may need to produce an adecuately formated document sometime, and [LaTeX](/search/label/LaTeX) may not be an option.

Deal with it. Install a VM, or Wine, and a copy of MS Office. Resistance is futile.
