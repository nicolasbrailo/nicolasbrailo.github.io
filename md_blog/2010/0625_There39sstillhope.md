A log time ago, in a galaxy far away, I [posted](/md_blog/2008/1009_aptgetnewcomputer.md) [a list](/md_blog/2008/1228_aptgetinstallnewcomputerII.md) [of stuff](/md_blog/2009/0519_aptgetinstallnewcomputerIII.md) I apt-get'd as soon as my Buguntu install was ready. Well, fast forward to KK and this is the new apt-get script:

```c++
sudo apt-get install opera mocp unclutter build-essential gimp \
        mmv gnome-do knetworkmanager xdiskusage iptraf sshfs \
        shntool cuetools flac wavpack unrar vlc vim gvim vim-doc \
        vim-full vim-gnome ddd devhelp doxygen doxygen-gui \
        exuberant-ctags ctags  subversion ifstat antiword
```

Quite a progress I'd say, as these are mostly programs I use which don't come in the default install (even though they should). You know, I even have hopes for [the sound system](/md_blog/2010/0504_UbuntuSoundstillFUBARd.md) in my notebook this time...
