Unix trivia day: in the olden days of the 90's there were a lot of Unix boxes out there named "elvis". Nowdays it's not uncommon to find one, either. Have you ever wondered why are there so many boxes called elvis?

This is related to Solaris' ping command. When you ping $HOST it prints "$HOST is alive" (if it's responding the pings), thus elvis is alive!
