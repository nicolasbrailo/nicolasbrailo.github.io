Seen @ http://wiki.wireshark.org/SNMP:

> After years thinking and reading RFCs and various other documents, today, I finally understood. "Simple" refers to "Network" not to "Management Protocol"! So it is a Management Protocol for Simple Networks not a Simple Protocol for Management of Networks... That explains why it's called "Simple". It was that Simple but it took me years to understand it! -- LuisOntanon

Thank you Luis. That explains a lot.
