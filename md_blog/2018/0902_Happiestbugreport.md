Something is wrong: I'm happy over a bug report!

A few years back I developed a [VlcRemote control](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/VlcFreemote) app for Android. According [to this chart](https://xkcd.com/1205/), I didn't actually save any time doing so. The time I spent spent developing the app is more than the cumulative time I would have spent by getting up from the couch and manually controlling VLC. That said, not having to leave the coziness of a warm blanket in winter probably made it worth the investment.

Not long ago I decided to [submit this app to F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nicolasbrailo.vlcfreemote/). I'm too cheap to pay the 20ish dollars for Google App Store, and since I don't have any commercial interest I don't see the point. I didn't think I'd actually get any users there, but today I got my first bug report. So much happiness! You'd think I shouldn't be happy about my crappy software not-working, but hey, someone actually took the time to try it out. Even more, someone cared enough to submit a bug report!

Open source rules!
