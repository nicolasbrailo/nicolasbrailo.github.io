Getting feedback from users is hard. In a platform such as Android, with apps evaluated in a couple of seconds, it's even harder.

While trying to get bug reports for [VlcFreemote](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/VlcFreemote) I found a neat GitHub trick: you can pre-fill a bug report by using url parameters. For example, check this link: <https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/VlcFreemote/issues/new?title=foo&body=bar>

Awesome! Takes a second and makes life much easier for bug-reporters!
