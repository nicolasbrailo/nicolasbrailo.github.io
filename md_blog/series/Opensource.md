Sometimes I decide to contribute something back to humanity. Others would say I unleash my crappy code to the world. In any case, here's something you can laugh at, be horrified about or maybe, maybe, find useful:

[VlcFreemote](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/VlcFreemote) - [Link to article](/blog_md/2016/0204_VLCFreemotenoneedtoleavethecouch.md)

[Pianoli](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Pianoli)
---------------------------------------------------

>
> A baby game for Android
>
> Have a baby curious about shiny tablets and phones? Use this app as a baby-game and, more importantly, to prevent random taps of a baby from doing anything you may not want.
>
> This app will show a small piano a baby can use to explore sounds in a mobile device. At the same time, it will block any naive attempts at closing the app. The back, home and apps-menu buttons will be blocked, and Android's top menu won't be available. This ensures a baby can't accidentally close the game, preventing any actions on the device you may not want.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>
> When you're on a long trip and you don't want to carry around a heavy computer just to manage your camera's SD card, this app can be a helpful tool. Using your tablet's SD card reader (or an OTG cable, if it has none) you can manage the photos taken in your trip, preview your snaps and make room for more by deleting those that you don't want. Let's you use [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) in Android.

[Godmin](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/godmin) - [Setting up a Linux GW/Router, a guide for non network admins](/search/label/Series%3A Linux GW)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>
> Godmin is intended as an application to \*easily administrate a Linux based gateway\*, but \*not as a one size fits all\* tool; Godmin was created with a very narrow audience in mind, it was created as a tool to easily administrate a Debian based gateway running ISC, bind and iptables, for a small to mid size LAN (10 to a 100 clients). You might find Godmin useful if you [...]

[[Vim plugin] BTN: Better tab new : Adds a tab new command accepting file:lin\_num as a parameter](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5405)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>
> Better tab new: replaces the default tabnew command with a slightly smarter version, capable of understanding line numbers. This is very useful for programming, where filenames are usually expressed as "fname:line number". Even when grepping, the output format will usualy be "path/to/file:42". BTN won't reject these strings, it will instead open them and move the cursor to the appropriate line.
