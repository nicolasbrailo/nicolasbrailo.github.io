# Weekend project: (Mini) audio science talk

Another project to file under "brilliant ideas": I spent the weekend (and a bit more, really) working on a [set of experiments to teach how audio works, for children](https://nicolasbrailo.github.io/SlidewareEngineering/MiniAudio/).

While [publishing my set of JS audio demos](https://nicolasbrailo.github.io/SlidewareEngineering) a few weeks back ([wonder if I need to credit AI, too](md_blog/2026/0119_JSAudioDemos.md)), I figured I should try to widen my audience beyond other software engineers. The material consists of simplified explanations of how audio transmission works, and how computers work with audio. Finding a balance between oversimplifying things and staying topic-relevant for children has been a challenge, but I'm quite happy with the final results. There are also plenty of experiments that, hopefully, will keep the session engaging.

While I doubt many 8 year olds are reading these notes, I'll be getting some feedback on this sessions soon. Wish me luck!
