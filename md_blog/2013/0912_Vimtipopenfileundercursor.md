If you have a bunch of #include's you don't need to manually type their path when you need to edit one of them; just place your cursor on top of the written path and remember these helpful commands:

```c++
gf	 open in the same window ("goto file")
f	 open in a new window (Ctrl-w f)
gf	 open in a new tab (Ctrl-w gf)
```
