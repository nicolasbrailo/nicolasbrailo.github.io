We all know the usual Vim moves, hjkl (though I admit I still use the arrows) et al, but there are some more obscure and very useful Vim moves, for the hipster in you. I only recently learned about L and H, for the beginning and the end of the screen.

I don't know how I lived so long without those. It's an incredibly useful shortcut.
