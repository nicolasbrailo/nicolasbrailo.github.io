It's been a while since I posted my Vimrc. That's probably because I don't really need to back it up in my blog anymore, now I just keep it in [my github repo](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Nico.rc/blob/master/vimrc).

Now whenever I get a new computer I just clone my repo and get for free my vimrc, my terminator rc and a bunch of useful scripts I regularly use on bash.
