I doubt this announcement will be of much use to anyone, but I've uploaded most of my latex presentations to my [github repo](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/powerpoint_monkey) (those for which I found the source code, anyway).

At least it's a great way to see crappy latex code which probably hasn't compiled in newer versions of latex for at least a couple of years.
