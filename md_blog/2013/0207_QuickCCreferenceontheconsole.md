What do you usually do when you don't remember whether fp is the first argument for fprintf or for fwrite? (Hint: it's the first argument for one, the last for the other. Handy, huh?). Well, there's no need to go and check the answer on Google, just sudo apt-get install manpages-dev and then do "man fprintf" or "man fwrite".

Note: you might also want posix-dev to check stuff like htons.
