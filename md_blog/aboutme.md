# About me

@meta docType notAPost

I am an information systems engineer who like to works on complex
problems, but still hasn’t managed to solve the complex problem of
having only 24 hours a day. Besides programming, I also like writing on
my blogs and giving classes or lectures on the subjects I like the most.
 I usually post these presentations in the blog, so keep track of the
changes here if you’re interested.

You can check <http://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolasbrailovsky> until I get to upload some more information here. Want to write to my gmail account? You can try at nicolas brailo.
