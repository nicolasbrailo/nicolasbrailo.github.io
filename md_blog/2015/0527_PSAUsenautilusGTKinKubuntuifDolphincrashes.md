So, for some reason my (brand new) Kubuntu is not very stable. KDE tends to randomly crash whenever I send a large-ish file to the recycling bin. Dunno why, looks like some threading + caching issue in dolphin, and I couldn't find a solution anywhere on the web. Well, there are two workarounds:

1. Don't use the recycling bin. This sort of breaks my workflow, so I prefer to:
2. Use nautilus.

You'll have to install gtk packages, but that's a small price to pay to have KDE not crash every couple of minutes.
