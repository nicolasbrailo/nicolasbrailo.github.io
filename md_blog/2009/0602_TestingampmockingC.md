Check [the previous post](/md_blog/2009/0602_TestingampmockingC.md) about this presentation.

[Where I work](http://www.intraway.com) we have been working a lot with unit testing and continuous integration. [This is a presentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolasbrailo/powerpoint_monkey/master/cpp_testing/cpp_testing_mocking.pdf) I worked with, about [unit testing](http://code.google.com/p/googletest) and [mocking](http://code.google.com/p/googlemock) tools in C++ (only in spanish, sorry).
