I've been using [Ubuntu 8.10](http://ubuntu.com) for couple of months and soon began to think about switching to [Debian](http://debian.org) or some other - more stable - distro. At work Ubuntu 8.10 seemd too unstable, with frequent crashes and slow. Instead of switching I decided to upgrade to 9.04 soon after its release, something I've always avoided (best to wait for a couple of months, until it gets more stable. Even better if it is an LTS). So far I must say this is the best Ubuntu relase I've seen.

Some highlights after the first couple of days:

* The install was flawless and quick. In fact I didn't even see it install, just left it running and went to another PC to install 8.04 (I was at [FLISOL](/blog_md/2009/0416_FLISOL.md)) and came back to a fully functioning system.

* Configuring my dual monitor setup at the office required some work but not more than 8.04 and 8.10.

* I'm still a little uncomfortable with the notification system but it's not worse than before (though I'm not sure if it's better).

* Still having some problems with SCIM on Opera, not sure who's at fault there.

* The boot times are FAST. In fact the whole thing seems fast and stable.

* The graphics handling are improved. Compiz works much better, I can even run it with my dual monitr setup (something I couldn't do with 8.10).

All in all, a great release and a must upgrade for sure. Ubuntu FTW!
