[Where I work](http://www.intraway.com) we have been working a lot with unit testing and continuous integration. [This is a presentation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolasbrailo/powerpoint_monkey/master/testing/testing_mocking.pdf) I worked with, about unit testing and mocking in general (language agnostic but only in spanish, sorry). The examples are in pseudo-ruby, check the next post for a presentation on C++ tools for testing and mocking.
