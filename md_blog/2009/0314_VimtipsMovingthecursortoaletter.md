Let's face it, Vim is the best editor in the world, and from now on there'll be a spot in the homepage with a "Vim Tip of the Week" (check the sidebar).

For the first one a basic tip:
 **Moving to a letter**

>
> While in command mode press '
>  *f*' and any other letter; the cursor will move to the first occurence of this letter. This can be combined with other commands and a number of repetitions (e.g. '
>  *d2f.*', to delete until the second dot).

As a sidenote, I guess there must be a Word Press plugin to display the latest post in a category but I coudn't find it, so I hacked my own: [tip-of-the-week](md_blog/2009/0314_TipoftheWeek.md)
