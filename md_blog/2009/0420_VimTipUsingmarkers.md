Set a marker if you whish Vim to remember a cursor position Use m\* to mark current position (use a to z for position names) and then '\* to move to mark \* (again, a to z).

This trick can be very useful when editing a large file (or lots of files) in case you need to quickly edit something and then return to the previous spot.
