A good friend of mine (a programming junkie just like me) just [started his blog](http://lsecotaro.blogspot.com/), so this is kind of a welcome. Actually there's already a link somewhere in this page so this post is just an excuse to post this recommendation about writing articles for a blog:

> Remember you didn't like books without pictures as a child? Well, Internet's mental age isn't a day over four years old, use pretty pictures whenever you can.
