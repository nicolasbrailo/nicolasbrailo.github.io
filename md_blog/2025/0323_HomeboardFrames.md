# Homeboard: Versioning frames

Since I've been fixing plenty of bugs, figured I should also start versioning my frame mount designs.

The Ikea-frame version should look something like this:

The design for this one lives here

You can download it an open it with Inkscape; remember to [switch to outline mode in Inkscape](md_blog/2025/0209_HomeboardIndustrialDesign.md), otherwise you're unlikely to see anything. The frames are designed for a laser engraver, and the cuts are about 1/100'th of a mm.

And the standalone vesion will hopefully look a bit less terrible than this, since this picture is from a few bug-revisions before:
