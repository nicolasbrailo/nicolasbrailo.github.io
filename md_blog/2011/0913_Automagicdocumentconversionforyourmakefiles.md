So, now you have [a common makefile](md_blog/2011/0818_Makefiles.md), ready to be used for a TDD project and for [code coverage report automagic generation](md_blog/2011/0830_AMakefileforcodecoveragereportwithC.md). Not only that, but it even [speaks to endlessly annoy your team](md_blog/2011/0906_Atalkingmakefile.md). What else can we add to this makefile? Well, automatic documentation generation, clearly.

> You want to batch convert .doc to .pdf using the command line on a server without a GUI? Or you need automated .ppt to .swf conversion through cron, a sysvinit service, or a remote web server? Online conversion services such as Zamzar.com and Media-convert.com not working for you? Whichever formats you need to batch convert, PyODConverter is a simple Python script for just this purpose.

[...] Oh, thanks a lot OO.org (?). BTW, exporting an odm to pdf with a headless set == FAIL (i.e. don't even try to use this if you intend to autogenerate some documentation with your makefile). [...]
