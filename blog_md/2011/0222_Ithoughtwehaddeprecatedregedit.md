Guys, I thought we had already agreed on this [a long time ago](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/08/was-the-windows-registry-a-good-idea.html). Windows registry sucks. It's a pain in the ass.

Why TF is [regedit](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreNautilusLocationBar) still used in Gnome? I'd switch to KDE, if only I wasn't so lazy.

NotReally, it's just a helper tool to avoid editing xml files.

Agreeing with NotReally, all gconf-editor is, is a user friendly wrapper for GNOME and surrounding graphical environment. Redegit is not even close to the same thing as it retains core system and subsystem values and variables. Everything in the Windows environment relies on the registry. With a GTK enabled environment, this is never the case.
