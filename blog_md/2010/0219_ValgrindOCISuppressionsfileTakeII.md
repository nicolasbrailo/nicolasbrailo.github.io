Remember my [OCI suppressions file](/blog_md/2009/0323_ValgrindOCISuppressionsfileFTW.md)? Well, since then I have updated it. Now it includes some more suppressions, for [libnetsnmp](http://www.net-snmp.org/), Oracle, [Berkeley DB](http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/berkeley-db/index.html), and may be something else I can't remember.

If you add anything else let me know in the comments.

BTW last time attaching this file failed so now I'm posting it in the first comment after this entry.
