OK, the hiatus is over. It's not like I've been sitting around doing nothing this last couple of months... well may be I have, but now I'm back. Kind off, I'm actually going out on vacations a couple of weeks in march but the blog will be on autopilotÂ  and there are quite a lot of posts in the backlog... there are a couple of months more worth of clever and informative (?) articles, so stay tuned (?^2).
