It's been a long time since I posted a Linux related tip. Not in the mood I guess... well, this is one which really annoyed me, until I found out how easy it is: I hate some of the default file associations in gnome. Movieplayer, for example, is a horrible choice. Breaking and devolving with each new distro release, I have decided to settle with vlc as my default movie player, yet I couldn't easily change the default file type association. After fiddling around with the thingy in gnome resembling a regedit (ugh) I found out the easy way:

\* Right click the file for which you want to change default associations and click properties
\* Select "open with" tab
\* ...
\* Profit!
