In the [I bet somebody got a really nice bonus](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/11/01/922449.aspx) category, I found this one while trying to compile MySQL++ on Solaris: <http://lists.mysql.com/plusplus/7811>.

Don't worry though. Now it'll be renamed to #define ORACLE.

PS: Kind of related is the story about Oracle breaking everything after a %s/Sun/Oracle in the JVM [1], though in that case I'm more inclined to blame sloppy programmers.
