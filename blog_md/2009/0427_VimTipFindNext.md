In normal mode, move the cursor to any word. How do you search for the next occurrence of that word?

Press the \* key to search forwards for the current word, or press # to search backwards.

Using \* or # searches for the exact word at the cursor (searching for rain would not find rainbow).

Use g\* or g# if you don't want to search for the exact word.
