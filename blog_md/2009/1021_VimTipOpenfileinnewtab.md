How many times have you been on a project which #includes another file and wanted to see what that file was? Well you can navigate the source code tree in a gui if you use eclipse. You can go to File > Open and, again, fight with a nice gui in Notepad. Or you can open up that file with four keystrokes in a real editor, THE real editor. Just use "C-W g f" with the cursor over the filename and it'll open in a new tab, ready for you to hack away more code.
