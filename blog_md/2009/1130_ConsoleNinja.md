My [latest presentation is now online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolasbrailo/powerpoint_monkey/master/bash_console_ninja/console_ninja.pdf): "Console ninja". Spanish only, at least for now.

On a related note: I'm taking some time off, in a week or so I'll be back to my (un)regular schedule.
