After some sick time, lots of work, prepearing my new blog (monosinfinitos.com.ar, go check it) and several other,personal stuff regular blog updates will resume tomorrow and continue at least for a week. That's about the buffer size I've left, after that I'll have to write something new or take a longer vacation... we'll see.

In the meantime, enjoy a pretty picture. [BROKENLINK]
