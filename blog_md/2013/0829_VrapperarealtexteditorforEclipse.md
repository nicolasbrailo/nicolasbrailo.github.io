It's been a while since I had to use Eclipse, and last time I did I was really disappointed at the lack of a real text editor embedded in it. There were a few Vim plugins for Eclipse back then, but all of them where paid. Luckly now there seems to be a decent open alternative: [http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/documentation/](http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/documentation/ "http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/documentation/")

Vrapper provides pretty decent text editing capabilities for Eclipse, I'd almost say it makes it usable. And, as a beneficial side effect, now your coworkers wont' be able to touch your Eclipse anymore!
