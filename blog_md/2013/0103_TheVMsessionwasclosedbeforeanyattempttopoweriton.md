Some times Virtualbox gets lazy and decides not to work, no explanation given (no, that cryptic message certainly doesn't count as an explanation). I have no idea what causes this message, at the moment my best theory is an improper planet alignment, but in my experience detaching all media from a VM, running it and then attaching all media again seems to fix the problem.
