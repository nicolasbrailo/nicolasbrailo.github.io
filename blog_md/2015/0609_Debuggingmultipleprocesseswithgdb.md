If your buggy program generates lots of child processes, gdb will keep attached to the parent program and let all the children run loose. If you're having problems to find what causesÂ  your crash this is probably not what you want: for those occasions gdb has a very helpful flag called detach on fork.

With [detach on fork](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Forks.html) you can tell gdb to keep debugging the parent, follow the children, or keep track of all processes. Must be nice to troubleshoot forkbombs with this option.
