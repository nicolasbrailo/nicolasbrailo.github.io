Hugging is pretty awesome to create panoramic photos. I use it regularly, for example for this awesome Prague old town square panoramic I took some time ago:

At some point I realized that, after an upgrade, Hugging just stopped finding connection points. Apparently there's a licences issue somewhere. Just "sudo apt-get install autopano-sift" and continue hugging.
