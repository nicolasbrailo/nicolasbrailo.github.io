    <title>Fix Spotify deeplinking in Linux + custom SpotiWeb UIExample post</title>
    <link>https://nicolasbrailo.github.io/blog/2023/1216_FixSpotifydeeplinkinginLinuxcustomSpotiWebUI.html</link>
    <description>
        After a recent update I found my custom Spotify UI (*) wasn't working. The way my custom UI works is by generating a simple list of followed artists, and then playing in the native app by using deep-linking. A recent update seems to have broken this in Linux based OSes, so here's my fix:

        <pre><code>
        sudo mv /usr/share/spotify/spotify /usr/share/spotify/spotify.real
        sudo echo '/usr/share/spotify/spotify.real --uri="$1"' > /usr/share/spotify/spotify
        </pre></code>

        Seems old versions of spotify would try to open anything as a deeplink, but new versions require a --uri parameter on argv. Surely there is a cleaner way of doing this in xdg-open, but I'm too lazy to read manuals.

        In the "reminder to myself" category, as there is zero chance I'll remember this next time I'm setting up a computer.
