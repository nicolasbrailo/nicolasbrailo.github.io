## Bash script preamble

All background Bash scripts should start with this preamble:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
exec > ~/log.log 2>&1
```

There are countless articles explaining why, and the main purpose of this one is a reminder for myself, so I won't go into the details. For reference:

* **-e** halts the script on error
* **-u** errors when using an undefined variable
* **-o pipefail** makes pipe error return value sane
* **exec > ~/log.log 2>&1** redirect all output to ~/log.log
