## Geotagging in Ubuntu: more broken than ever

This is depressing. All the geotagging tools in Ubuntu seem dead. Even mine, apparently the latest version of CEF Python changed something that breaks my app. Even worse, looking for "ubuntu geotagging" has my own blog as one of the top results... time to fix my code, I guess?
