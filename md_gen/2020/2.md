## jq: grep and prettify json

Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2020-02-27 | [Permalink](md_blog/2020/0227_jqgrepandprettifyjson.md) | [3 comments](md_blog/2020/0227_jqgrepandprettifyjson.md) | [Leave a comment](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/nicolasbrailo.github.io/issues/new?title=Comment@md_blog/2020/0227_jqgrepandprettifyjson.md&body=I%20have%20a%20comment!)

If you don't use [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/), you are missing a very important utility in your bash toolset. jq let's you query and filter json files from a cli. Just like awk or sed, js's "language" is basically write only, meaning whenever you need to do something there's a 99% chance you'll just be copy-pasting recipes from Stackoverflow until you find the one that works for you. Here are a couple of recipes I found most useful:

**cat a json file - with pretty print**

```c++
jq . /path/to/json_file
```

**Select a single key**

```c++
jq '.path.to.key'
```

The command above will return "42" for a json that looks like "{path: {to: {key: 42}}}"

**Delete all entries in an object, except for one**

```c++
jq '.foo|=bar'
```

The command above will return "{foo: {bar:''}}" for a json that looks like "{foo: {bar:'', baz: ''}}"

This is probably not even enough to get started. Luckily there's plenty of docs to read @ <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/>

## Mixin(ish) classes with parameter packs in C++

Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2020-02-18 | [Permalink](md_blog/2020/0218_MixinishclasseswithparameterpacksinC.md) | [2 comments](md_blog/2020/0218_MixinishclasseswithparameterpacksinC.md) | [Leave a comment](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/nicolasbrailo.github.io/issues/new?title=Comment@md_blog/2020/0218_MixinishclasseswithparameterpacksinC.md&body=I%20have%20a%20comment!)

For some reason I couldn't find many examples of how to use a parameter pack as a mixin, to enable different features with no runtime overhead. Here is a full example of you might implement this (be aware there are some nasal daemons in the code below!). The technique is really based on this one line:

```c++
 int dummy[sizeof...(Config)] = { (Config::apply(p), 0)... };
```

This idiom will unpack a parameter pack and call T::apply, for each T in the parameter pack. You can use this idiom to build very clean mixin-type interfaces with static dispatch, or to build job security.

Full example:

```c++
struct EnableFeatureA {
  template &lt;typename T&gt; static void apply(T *a) {
    cout &lt;&lt; a-&gt;a() &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
};

struct EnableFeatureB {
  template &lt;typename T&gt; static void apply(T *a) {
    cout &lt;&lt; T::b() &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
};

template &lt;typename Impl, typename... Config&gt;
struct Foo {
  Foo(){
    // Call apply() for each type in Config
    Impl *p = nullptr;
    int dummy[sizeof...(Config)] = { (Config::apply(p), 0)... };
  }
};

struct Bar;
using FwdFoo = Foo&lt;Bar, EnableFeatureA, EnableFeatureB&gt;;

struct Bar : FwdFoo {
   int a() { return 4; }
   static int b() { return 2; }
};
```
