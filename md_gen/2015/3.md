## Scope ending in C++

Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2015-03-31 | [Permalink](md_blog/2015/0331_ScopeendinginC.md) | [2 comments](md_blog/2015/0331_ScopeendinginC.md) | [Leave a comment](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/nicolasbrailo.github.io/issues/new?title=Comment@md_blog/2015/0331_ScopeendinginC.md&body=I%20have%20a%20comment!)

Is the following code valid C++?

```c++
const int x = 42;
void f() {
    int x[x];
    x[24] = 0;
}
```

Unfortunately, it is. According to 3.3.2 in the standard, a definition is available in a child scope up to the point where it's shadowed, and that means "x" will first be interpreted as the global const int, being an index for a vector named "x". Any new references to "x" will point to the new declaration.

Fun stuff, right?
