## VimTip: Search and f(replace)

Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2019-02-26 | [Permalink](md_blog/2019/0226_VimTipSearchandfreplace.md)  | [Leave a comment](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/nicolasbrailo.github.io/issues/new?title=Comment@md_blog/2019/0226_VimTipSearchandfreplace.md&body=I%20have%20a%20comment!)

Pre-tip: When using search and replace in Vim, [you don't need to use slashes](md_blog/2015/0507_VimtipStopescapingslashes.md)
This works just fine:

```c++
%s#search#replace
```

Did you know $replace doesn't have to be a literal expression? You can also use Vim functions! For example:

```c++
%s#bar#\=line(&#x27;.&#x27;)
```

will replace every occurrence of 'bar' for its line number. You can get creative and use any other Vimscript function.
