Plug for a new [script I've been working on: https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/ChromecasticSlideshow](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/ChromecasticSlideshow):

Slideshows in Chromecast directly from your filesystem, without going through any online service. No Google Photos, Facebook or anything else: plain old random files straight from your disk to your Chromecast.

Hope someone else finds this useful!
