## -Wmisleading-indentation

This gcc switch is a few years old but I discovered it recently. I'm not sure if that means my code is always very clean or my toolchain too oudated... in any case, -Wmisleading-indentation (which you get with -Wall) warns about this gotcha:

```c++
if (foo)
   bar();
   baz();
```

Neat!

## GitHub tip: Prefill a bug report

Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2018-09-04 - [Permalink](md_blog/2018/0904_GitHubtipPrefillabugreport.md)  - [Leave a comment](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/nicolasbrailo.github.io/issues/new?title=Comment@md_blog/2018/0904_GitHubtipPrefillabugreport.md&body=I%20have%20a%20comment!)

Getting feedback from users is hard. In a platform such as Android, with apps evaluated in a couple of seconds, it's even harder.

While trying to get bug reports for [VlcFreemote](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/VlcFreemote) I found a neat GitHub trick: you can pre-fill a bug report by using url parameters. For example, check this link: <https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/VlcFreemote/issues/new?title=foo&body=bar>

Awesome! Takes a second and makes life much easier for bug-reporters!

## Happiest bug report

Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2018-09-02 - [Permalink](md_blog/2018/0902_Happiestbugreport.md)  - [Leave a comment](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/nicolasbrailo.github.io/issues/new?title=Comment@md_blog/2018/0902_Happiestbugreport.md&body=I%20have%20a%20comment!)

Something is wrong: I'm happy over a bug report!

A few years back I developed a [VlcRemote control](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/VlcFreemote) app for Android. According [to this chart](https://xkcd.com/1205/), I didn't actually save any time doing so. The time I spent spent developing the app is more than the cumulative time I would have spent by getting up from the couch and manually controlling VLC. That said, not having to leave the coziness of a warm blanket in winter probably made it worth the investment.

Not long ago I decided to [submit this app to F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nicolasbrailo.vlcfreemote/). I'm too cheap to pay the 20ish dollars for Google App Store, and since I don't have any commercial interest I don't see the point. I didn't think I'd actually get any users there, but today I got my first bug report. So much happiness! You'd think I shouldn't be happy about my crappy software not-working, but hey, someone actually took the time to try it out. Even more, someone cared enough to submit a bug report!

Open source rules!
