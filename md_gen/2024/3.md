## Vim can wget + c-w search

Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2024-03-03 | [Permalink](md_blog/2024/0303_VimWgetSite.md)  | [Leave a comment](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/nicolasbrailo.github.io/issues/new?title=Comment@md_blog/2024/0303_VimWgetSite.md&body=I%20have%20a%20comment!)

I (re?)learned a thing today: Vim can wget a site!

Doing `c-w gf` tells Vim to open whatever path is under the cursor. This is usually something like "#include <foo/bar/baz.h>", which means it will ask Vim to open `foo/bar/baz.h`. If you happen to have `http://nicolasbrailo.github.io` under your cursor, you'll be fetching this site into a temp buffer, in Vim.

## Bonus tip:

If `c-w gf` isn't finding the files you want it to, you may need to set your search path:

```vim
set path+=/home/user/path/to/foo,/home/user/src/bar
```

## Wifi from the CLI

Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2024-03-01 | [Permalink](md_blog/2024/0302_CLIWifi.md)  | [Leave a comment](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/nicolasbrailo.github.io/issues/new?title=Comment@md_blog/2024/0302_CLIWifi.md&body=I%20have%20a%20comment!)

Another one to file in the category of self reminders, and a cheatsheet I'll need this weekend: whenever I need to work on the main (eth!) connection of a server, instead of grabbing a keyboard and a monitor it's easier to connect to wifi. For example, when I need to change the IP of a Raspberry PI in my network. Note this guide assumes a Debian-like environment:

```bash
# Figure out which interfaces exist
ip a

# Figure out which interfaces are connected
ip link show
# For example:
ip link show wlp3s0
```

Restart the interface (which will do nothing, because it's probably not autoconfigurable)

```
ip link set wlp3s0 down
ip link set wlp3s0 up
```

Start `wpa_cli`. Creating a new network may be needed, but I don't have notes. Once a network is created, its config will be in `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`. Then:

```bash
$ wpa_cli
> scan
[Wait a few seconds]
> scan_results
>
```

Connect:

```bash
# Connect
wpa_supplicant -B -i wlp3s -c < $( wpa_passphrase "your ssid name" "password" )
# Request IP
dhclient wlp3s0
# Confirm connection
ip addr show wlp3s0
```

Work on main interface (leave on a loop, in case wifi disconnects for whatever reason)

```bash
while true; do dhclient -r eno1 ; dhclient eno1 ; ip addr show eno1; sleep 1; echo "DONE"; done 
```

When done, kill wifi

```bash
ip link set wlp3s0 down
# Release addr locally
dhclient -r wlp3s0
# To be sure:
rfkill
```

## Bash: goto

Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2024-03-01 | [Permalink](md_blog/2024/0301_BashGoto.md)  | [Leave a comment](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/nicolasbrailo.github.io/issues/new?title=Comment@md_blog/2024/0301_BashGoto.md&body=I%20have%20a%20comment!)

I rediscovered a nifty little utility I added to my [bashrc](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Nico.rc) a while back: [goto](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Nico.rc/blob/master/bash/goto.sh). Goto is a short script that works as a bookmark mechanism for Bash. With it, you can set a bookmark directory, and then jump to that directory from anywhere else (with autocomplete). For example:

```bash
$ cd foo/bar/baz
foo/bar/baz$ goto . bookmark
foo/bar/baz$ cd /
/$ goto boo<tab>
foo/bar/baz$
```

It works by setting itself as a Bash autocomplete, so that bookmarks are autocompletable and available anywhere in Bash. A bookmark is itself nothing more than a symlink saved to `~/goto`.

To install, you can `wget -O - https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Nico.rc/blob/master/bash/goto.sh > ~/.goto.sh` and add it to your bashrc.
