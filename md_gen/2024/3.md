## Bash: list ALSA PCMs

Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2024-03-04 | [Permalink](md_blog/2024/0304_FindRightPCM.md)  | [Leave a comment](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/nicolasbrailo.github.io/issues/new?title=Comment@md_blog/2024/0304_FindRightPCM.md&body=I%20have%20a%20comment!)

Linux audio isn't friendly, even if pipewire is making huge strides in making it "just work". If you ever find you need to get down to the ALSA level, something is probably very broken. If (when) this happens, and you can't figure out which of your ALSA cards you should be using, just try them all:


```bash
set -euo pipefail

if [ -z "${1+x}" ] || [ ! -f "${1}" ]; then
  echo "Will iterate over all known PCMs to try to capture or play audio and report which work"
  echo "Usage: $0 PLAYABLE_FILE"
  exit 1
fi

sample=${1}
plays_pcms=$( aplay --list-pcms | grep ':CARD=' )
for dev in $plays_pcms; do
  aplay --duration=1 --device="$dev" "$sample" 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null && \
    echo "Playback may work on interface '$dev'"
done

cap_pcms=$( arecord --list-pcms | grep ':CARD=' )
for dev in $cap_pcms; do
  arecord --rate 48000 -f S16_LE --disable-resample --duration=1 --device="$dev" \
      /dev/null 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null && \
      echo "Capture may work on interface '$dev'"
done
```

## Vim can wget + c-w search

Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2024-03-03 | [Permalink](md_blog/2024/0303_VimWgetSite.md)  | [Leave a comment](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/nicolasbrailo.github.io/issues/new?title=Comment@md_blog/2024/0303_VimWgetSite.md&body=I%20have%20a%20comment!)

I (re?)learned a thing today: Vim can wget a site!

Doing `c-w gf` tells Vim to open whatever path is under the cursor. This is usually something like "#include <foo/bar/baz.h>", which means it will ask Vim to open `foo/bar/baz.h`. If you happen to have `http://nicolasbrailo.github.io` under your cursor, you'll be fetching this site into a temp buffer, in Vim.

## Bonus tip:

If `c-w gf` isn't finding the files you want it to, you may need to set your search path:

```vim
set path+=/home/user/path/to/foo,/home/user/src/bar
```

## Wifi from the CLI

Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2024-03-01 | [Permalink](md_blog/2024/0302_CLIWifi.md)  | [Leave a comment](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/nicolasbrailo.github.io/issues/new?title=Comment@md_blog/2024/0302_CLIWifi.md&body=I%20have%20a%20comment!)

Another one to file in the category of self reminders, and a cheatsheet I'll need this weekend: whenever I need to work on the main (eth!) connection of a server, instead of grabbing a keyboard and a monitor it's easier to connect to wifi. For example, when I need to change the IP of a Raspberry PI in my network. Note this guide assumes a Debian-like environment:

```bash
# Figure out which interfaces exist
ip a

# Figure out which interfaces are connected
ip link show
# For example:
ip link show wlp3s0
```

Restart the interface (which will do nothing, because it's probably not autoconfigurable)

```
ip link set wlp3s0 down
ip link set wlp3s0 up
```

Start `wpa_cli`. Creating a new network may be needed, but I don't have notes. Once a network is created, its config will be in `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`. Then:

```bash
$ wpa_cli
> scan
[Wait a few seconds]
> scan_results
>
```

Connect:

```bash
# Connect
wpa_supplicant -B -i wlp3s -c < $( wpa_passphrase "your ssid name" "password" )
# Request IP
dhclient wlp3s0
# Confirm connection
ip addr show wlp3s0
```

Work on main interface (leave on a loop, in case wifi disconnects for whatever reason)

```bash
while true; do dhclient -r eno1 ; dhclient eno1 ; ip addr show eno1; sleep 1; echo "DONE"; done 
```

When done, kill wifi

```bash
ip link set wlp3s0 down
# Release addr locally
dhclient -r wlp3s0
# To be sure:
rfkill
```

## Bash: goto

Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2024-03-01 | [Permalink](md_blog/2024/0301_BashGoto.md)  | [Leave a comment](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/nicolasbrailo.github.io/issues/new?title=Comment@md_blog/2024/0301_BashGoto.md&body=I%20have%20a%20comment!)

I rediscovered a nifty little utility I added to my [bashrc](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Nico.rc) a while back: [goto](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Nico.rc/blob/master/bash/goto.sh). Goto is a short script that works as a bookmark mechanism for Bash. With it, you can set a bookmark directory, and then jump to that directory from anywhere else (with autocomplete). For example:

```bash
$ cd foo/bar/baz
foo/bar/baz$ goto . bookmark
foo/bar/baz$ cd /
/$ goto boo<tab>
foo/bar/baz$
```

It works by setting itself as a Bash autocomplete, so that bookmarks are autocompletable and available anywhere in Bash. A bookmark is itself nothing more than a symlink saved to `~/goto`.

To install, you can `wget -O - https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Nico.rc/blob/master/bash/goto.sh > ~/.goto.sh` and add it to your bashrc.
