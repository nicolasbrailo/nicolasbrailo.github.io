## Homeboard P0: Stonebaked Margherita

**Homeboard P0 has been built!!1**

After figuring out [how to run my own LCD panel](md_blog/2024/0707_HouseboardHdmiToEdp.md), it was just a question of buying the right cables. I wanted to build a homeboard, and I thought I'd spend a ton of time writing cool software. Turns out 90% of the project is a game of "did I buy the right cable". Eventually I did end up with enough cables to build this monstrosity:

You are admiring a:

* Raspberry Pi zero,
* Powered over ethernet, with a PoE adapter
* The Raspberry Pi Zero powers the LCD controller board
* But the controller board needs 12V, so there is a DC-DC board that bumps the 5V from the RaspberryPi to the 12V the board needs.

(Full list of materials further down, so you don't need to hunt all of these)

Here the glorious moment everything is connected together, and actually boots an OS:

Of course at this point I realized the weak point of my design is on the mechanical linkage between the different boards. To tame this quite literally unwieldy hodgepodge of cables, I ate a pizza:

Using the cardboard box of a pizza, some ducktape and a few M2 screws, I built a beautiful hack mount for all my boards, which let me move the assembly around for tests. This was enough for quick power checks, but pizza box cardboard isn't a very durable material. I upgraded to a full frame:

This is an Ikea picture frame, with an LCD screen tapped to the front and a hole in the back for the eDP connector. Everything mounted together:

And the glorious, glorious first boot of the Stonebaked Margherita Homeboard P0:

Of course at this stage the only thing the Houseboard P0 does is boot. An achievement, but not too useful. Next up, I'll make it do something. Possibly crash.

## Houseboard P0: HDMI to eDP

Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2024-07-07 | [Permalink](md_blog/2024/0707_HouseboardHdmiToEdp.md)  | [Leave a comment](https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/nicolasbrailo.github.io/issues/new?title=Comment@md_blog/2024/0707_HouseboardHdmiToEdp.md&body=I%20have%20a%20comment!)

Minor victory in my quest to build a houseboard based on a Linux-PoE-netboot-RaspberryPi-etc: I figured out how to run my own LCD panel.

[![](/blog_img/0707_HouseboardHdmiToEdp/1DPtoeDP.jpg)](/blog_img/0707_HouseboardHdmiToEdp/1DPtoeDP.jpg)

The first step was verifying my panel worked. For this, I used a display port to eDP converter. Turns out eDP is basically DP, but over a ribbon cable. There are some cheap boards, [for example](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006914739674.html), that do this - searching for "DP to eDP" or "display port to eDP" will yield a high number of vendors. The key part is matching the ribbon type of the panel you need to drive (30 or 40 pins).

Unfortunatelly, single-board-computers (like the RaspberryPi) don't have DP, despite DP being better than HDMI in every way. The cost of adding a DP connector seems to be high and mosty in licenses, not necessarily in components, so SBCs don't do it. This meant that getting my expensive GPU to use my cheap panel wasn't good for much beyond knowing the panel works.

Fortunatelly, I managed to find a board that liked my panel:

[![](/blog_img/0707_HouseboardHdmiToEdp/2HDMItoeDP.jpg)](/blog_img/0707_HouseboardHdmiToEdp/2HDMItoeDP.jpg)

I got a "[PCB-800807V6-1HDMI-EDP 30PIN LCD driver board](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32968710965.html)", which comes at about Â£10 and supports multiple resolutions. This was a nice lucky find, and it unblocked the build of HouseboardP0, which I'll document in some other entry.
