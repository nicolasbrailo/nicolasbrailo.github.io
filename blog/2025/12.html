<p>Confession time: I like Makefiles!</p>
<p>With the baitclick out of the way: Makefiles, in 2025, can still be incredibly useful. Traditionally we think about Makefiles as a build system, however I realized it works much better as a list of notes. For my projects, I tend to use Makefiles as a documentation mechanism to remember things I did, and may need to repeat in the future. A few examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I keep my list of deps in Makefiles: I tend to keep a <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/homeboard/blob/main/Makefile#L71">target called 'system_deps' or similar</a>, where I can see which apt-get's I ran to get a specific service up and running. This extends to other things that already have their own "history" in place, <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/zigbee2mqtt2web/blob/master/Makefile#L38">like pipfiles</a>, but I found less than reliable in the past: when moving between targets with different architectures, for example, I found dealing with pipfiles quite tedious. My trusty <code>make system_deps</code> may take longer and is less elegant, but has never failed me so far!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing is easier with Makefiles: Running test targets can make life a lot easier. Sure, I could remember that <code>wlr-randr --output HDMI-A-1 --off</code> will shutdown a display... if I did it every day. I can also read the manual, or even create a small script to "remember" it. But it's a lot neater to keep these <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/wl-display-toggle/blob/main/Makefile#L11">small, project-dependent, one-off commands</a> as a list in my Makefile. Then I only need to <code>cd</code> to a project, and <code>make &lt;tab&gt;&lt;tab&gt;</code> to remember how to test things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Self-testing documentation: I keep <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/rpiz-xcompile/blob/main/Makefile#L1">targets that are the equivalent of a hello-world</a>, but quickly let me document how a complex system is meant to be used. Whenever I need to ramp-up a new project, or go back to a project after a few months, a Makefile can help me get up to speed in a few minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building things, write-only: Ok this one doesn't fall in the "documentation" category but unsurprisingly, <code>make</code> is actually <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/homeboard_ambience/blob/9ae0470935734603277ec0c181268ca5f4a4ea25/Makefile#L74">pretty useful at building things</a>. There may be better, more modern and certainly more maintainable options, however few are as simple as Makefiles. Yes, Makefiles code is horrible. For anything except the most trivial work, I consider them write-only code: you write it once, and no one can ever decipher how they work, ever again. Need to make a change to a Makefile? Better start from scratch, with a blank file. It will save you time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As long as you work within the constrains of the tool (keep it simple, or accept it's write-only code), Makefiles are still a wonderful tool 50 years after their invention.</p>
