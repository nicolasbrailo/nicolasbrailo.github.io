<h1>Crazy git error<a name="crazygiterror"></a></h1>
<p>Have you ever run into this error message on git before?</p>
<p>fatal: example.com/repo.git/info/refs not found: did you run git update-server-info on the server?</p>
<p>It can be very baffling, because it may happen even if you change absolutely nothing in your git&rsquo;s configuration. I&rsquo;ve read most people attribute this to a typo, and that seems to be the most common case, but I found yet another thing that might trigger this error: if you have set a proxy server, for example for wget, using an environment variable like http_proxy, https_proxy or ftp_proxy then git might be tripping up on your proxy and producing this error message.</p>
