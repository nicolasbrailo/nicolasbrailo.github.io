<h1>Automagically setup breakpoints with gdb<a name="automagicallysetupbreakpointswithgdb"></a></h1>
<p>When you are trying to debug a project you don't know you'll probably end up recompiling a few times, then restarting your debugging session. This can be quite frustrating, when you have gdb workset <a href="/blog/2013/0704_Myowngdbcheatsheetjustbecause.html">full of breakpoints</a>, <a href="/blog/2013/0625_Watchpointsingdbwakemeupwhenfoochanges.html">watch expressions</a> and all that stuff.</p>
<p>Luckily you can easily restore your state if you just write all the gdb commands you need into a file, then start gdb with "--command=state.gdb". Magic! All your breakpoints are there.</p>
<p>Alternatively, an even better solution: just don't exit gdb after recompiling, simply "kill" your currently under-debug process (ie type "kill" inside gdb, do not kill gdb itself!) and gdb will be smart enough to reload your binary if it changed.</p>
