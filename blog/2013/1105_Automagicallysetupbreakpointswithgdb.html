<h1>Automagically setup breakpoints with gdb<a name="automagicallysetupbreakpointswithgdb"></a></h1>
<p>When you are trying to debug a project you don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;ll probably end up recompiling a few times, then restarting your debugging session. This can be quite frustrating, when you have gdb workset <a href="/blog/2013/0704_Myowngdbcheatsheetjustbecause.html">full of breakpoints</a>, <a href="/blog/2013/0625_Watchpointsingdbwakemeupwhenfoochanges.html">watch expressions</a> and all that stuff.</p>
<p>Luckily you can easily restore your state if you just write all the gdb commands you need into a file, then start gdb with &ldquo;&ndash;command=state.gdb&rdquo;. Magic! All your breakpoints are there.</p>
<p>Alternatively, an even better solution: just don&rsquo;t exit gdb after recompiling, simply &ldquo;kill&rdquo; your currently under-debug process (ie type &ldquo;kill&rdquo; inside gdb, do not kill gdb itself!) and gdb will be smart enough to reload your binary if it changed.</p>
