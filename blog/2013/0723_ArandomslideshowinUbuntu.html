<h1>A random slideshow in Ubuntu<a name="arandomslideshowinubuntu"></a></h1>
<p>The other day I wanted to use my tv for a slideshow of my travel pictures. Something simple, just select a folder and have a program like Shotwell create a slideshow with a random order on my tv. Of course, Ubuntu and double screen equals fail. For some reaason all the programs I tried either were incapable of using the tv as the slideshow screen (even after cloning screens&hellip; now that&rsquo;s a wtf) or where not able to recursively use all the pictures in a folder.</p>
<p>feh to the rescue. It&rsquo;s not pretty, but feh seems to be exactly what I was looking for. It&rsquo;s a CLI application for Linux and after some RTFM I came up with this script:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">feh ~/Pictures \
     &ndash;scale-down \
     &ndash;geometry 1920x760 \
     &ndash;slideshow-delay 9 \
     &ndash;recursive \
     &ndash;randomize \
     &ndash;auto-zoom \
     &ndash;draw-filename \
     &ndash;image-bg black
</pre>
<p>You can probably figure out by yourself what each option means. If not, just man feh.</p>

<p>Hi Nicolas,
Thanks for this, I was amazed that none of the several programs I have, (gwenview, shotwell, default image viewer etc) allow you to simply start a slideshow and have it show in a random order. I can&rsquo;t get feh to work on my second monitor(even with &ndash;geometry 1920x1080+1800+0). I think that&rsquo;s a twin view issue though as from what I have read it only supports parts of xinerama.</p>
<p>Thanks again
John
