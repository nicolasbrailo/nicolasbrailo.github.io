<h1>Powerpoint monkey<a name="powerpointmonkey"></a></h1>
<p>I doubt this announcement will be of much use to anyone, but I&rsquo;ve uploaded most of my latex presentations to my <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/powerpoint_monkey">github repo</a> (those for which I found the source code, anyway).</p>
<p>At least it&rsquo;s a great way to see crappy latex code which probably hasn&rsquo;t compiled in newer versions of latex for at least a couple of years.</p>
