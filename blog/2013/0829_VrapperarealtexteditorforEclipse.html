<h1>Vrapper: a real text editor for Eclipse<a name="vrapperarealtexteditorforeclipse"></a></h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I had to use Eclipse, and last time I did I was really disappointed at the lack of a real text editor embedded in it. There were a few Vim plugins for Eclipse back then, but all of them where paid. Luckly now there seems to be a decent open alternative: <a href="http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/documentation/" title="http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/documentation/">http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/documentation/</a></p>
<p>Vrapper provides pretty decent text editing capabilities for Eclipse, I&rsquo;d almost say it makes it usable. And, as a beneficial side effect, now your coworkers wont&rsquo; be able to touch your Eclipse anymore!</p>
