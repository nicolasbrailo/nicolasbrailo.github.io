<h1>Vim tips: my github's vimrc<a name="vimtipsmygithubsvimrc"></a></h1>
<p>It's been a while since I posted my Vimrc. That's probably because I don't really need to back it up in my blog anymore, now I just keep it in <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Nico.rc/blob/master/vimrc">my github repo</a>.</p>
<p>Now whenever I get a new computer I just clone my repo and get for free my vimrc, my terminator rc and a bunch of useful scripts I regularly use on bash.</p>
