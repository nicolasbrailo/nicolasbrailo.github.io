<h1>A tardis in gdb? Reverse a program&rsquo;s execution!<a name="atardisingdbreverseaprogramsexecution"></a></h1>
<p>Have you ever been running a long debug session only to find you missed the spot by overstepping? I sure have and that can be one of the strongest motivators to invent a time machine. And it seems I&rsquo;m not the only one who thinks so, given that gdb can now travel back in time. That&rsquo;s right, you can save a snapshot of a running program and then reverse the polarity to go back in time, just before you missed your breakpoint!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very simple to use too, you don&rsquo;t need six people to use this feature. Just type &ldquo;checkpoint&rdquo; in gdb to let it know you want to record the execution&rsquo;s state, then &ldquo;restore N&rdquo; to go back in time. I&rsquo;ve recorded a sample debugging session:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">(gdb) list
1   int main()
2   {
3       int a = 1;
4       int b =2 ;
5       a = b;
6       b = 42;
7       return 0;
8   }
(gdb) run
Breakpoint 1, main () at test.cpp:3
3       int a = 1;
(gdb) n
4       int b =2 ;
(gdb) p a
$1 = 1
</pre>
<p>Next, create a checkpoint:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">(gdb) checkpoint
checkpoint: fork returned pid 29192.
</pre>
<p>Interesting: a checkpoint is actually implemented as a fork. Moving on:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">(gdb) n
5       a = b;
(gdb) n
6       b = 42;
(gdb) p a
$2 = 2
</pre>
<p>Ohnoes! We overstepped. Let&rsquo;s go back:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">(gdb) restart 1
Switching to process 29192
#0  main () at test.cpp:4
4       int b =2 ;
(gdb) p a
$3 = 1
</pre>
<p>And we&rsquo;re back in time.</p>
<h2>How does it work<a name="howdoesitwork"></a></h2>
<p>Reversing to a previous execution state is not an easy task. Gdb implements this feature by forking out a new process, a process we can later switch to. This means that reverting to a previous state might break things. The way forking is implemented in Linux, things like open files shouldn&rsquo;t be much of a problem. Sockets should still be connected but, of course, whatever you already sent won&rsquo;t be &ldquo;unsent&rdquo;.</p>
