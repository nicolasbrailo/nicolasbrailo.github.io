<h1>Vim tip: remember undos<a name="vimtiprememberundos"></a></h1>
<p>Git makes this feature rather obsolete, but it&rsquo;s still a nifty trick: Vim can remember your undos even if you close it. To enable this feature just &ldquo;<strong>set undofile</strong>&rdquo; and now Vim will unforgivingly remember your mistakes. For ever.</p>
