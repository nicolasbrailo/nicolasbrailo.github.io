<h1>A coverage report for C++ unit tests<a name="acoveragereportforcunittests"></a></h1>
<p>A lot of tools and metrics which are pretty much given for some dynamic languages are quite esoteric in C++ land. Unit testing is one of these tools, and so code coverage metrics is even more obscure in C++. Turns out it's not impossible. I have uploaded an <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/gcov_gtest_sample">example C++ project with unit tests and code coverage report generation</a>. Shouldn't be to hard to adapt this code to your own project.</p>
<p>Let's analyze some of the core concepts of this example.</p>
<h3>Unit testing<a name="unittesting"></a></h3>
<p>A coverage report only makes sense if you have a suite of unit/integration tests. gtest and gmock have worked the best for me but I guess anything that can run a suit of tests will be good to get a coverage report.</p>
<h3>Getting some coverage<a name="gettingsomecoverage"></a></h3>
<p>gcov is a simple utility you can find on Linunx to generate coverage reports. gcc has support for it, you just need to compile with "-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage --coverage" and link with "--coverage -lgcov". If you see the <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/gcov_gtest_sample/blob/master/Makefile#L10">line 10 on the makefile for the example project</a>, you'll see I define a new build type, special for coverage report.</p>
<p>Once the project is built with support for gcov, <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/gcov_gtest_sample/blob/master/Makefile#L49">running the tests</a> will generate a bunch of stats for lcov to pick up. The makefile includes <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/gcov_gtest_sample/blob/master/Makefile#L67">a target</a> that takes care of all these steps, compiling the program with gcov support, running the tests and then collecting the results into a nice html report.</p>
<h3>Getting it running<a name="gettingitrunning"></a></h3>
<p>Unfortunatelly, generating a coverage report has a lot of dependencies in C++. For the example on my github repository you'll have to install lcov, cppcheck, gtest, gmock and vera++ (a code style checker for C++ which is now discontinued... you should probably search for a replacement). Once you have it running, though, you can easily integrate this with your jenkins setup.</p>
