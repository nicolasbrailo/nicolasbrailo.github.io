<h1>Vim tip: open file under cursor<a name="vimtipopenfileundercursor"></a></h1>
<p>If you have a bunch of #include's you don't need to manually type their path when you need to edit one of them; just place your cursor on top of the written path and remember these helpful commands:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">gf   open in the same window (&quot;goto file&quot;)
f    open in a new window (Ctrl-w f)
gf   open in a new tab (Ctrl-w gf)
</pre>
