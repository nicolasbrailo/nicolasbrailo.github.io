<h1>Human friendly c declarations<a name="humanfriendlycdeclarations"></a></h1>
<p>An appropriate use of typedef&rsquo;s can transform 99% of c&rsquo;s gruesome type declarations into a mostly maintainable and maybe even readable piece of code. For that remaining 1%, or if you got a legacy application from someone with a very twisted mind, you&rsquo;ll probably need a way decode what &ldquo;int (*(Foo::*foo)(void**))[3]&rdquo; means.</p>
<p>To decipher weird c declarations go to <a href="http://cdecl.org/" title="http://cdecl.org/">http://cdecl.org/</a> and type your type. It works for most cases&hellip; good luck trying to figure out templates, though, for template metaprogramming you are on your own.</p>
