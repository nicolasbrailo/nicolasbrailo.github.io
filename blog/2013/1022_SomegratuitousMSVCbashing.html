<h1>Some gratuitous MSVC bashing<a name="somegratuitousmsvcbashing"></a></h1>
<p>Recently I found out Microsoft&rsquo;s Visual Studio doesn&rsquo;t support alternative tokens (ie &ldquo;and&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;&amp;&amp;&rdquo;). Even worse than that, apparently they don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s even necessary. And by the looks of <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/751842/alternative-tokens-dont-work">this thread</a>, the people working on MSVC need to take some time to actually READ the cpp standard. You know&hellip; it&rsquo;s kind of like a spec for your product. It&rsquo;s always good to take some time to understand the specs for your product&hellip;</p>
<p>I can only imagine how incredibly ugly their lexer must be to say it&rsquo;s not a fixable problem.</p>
