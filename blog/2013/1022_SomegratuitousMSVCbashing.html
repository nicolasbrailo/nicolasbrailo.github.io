<h1>Some gratuitous MSVC bashing<a name="somegratuitousmsvcbashing"></a></h1>
<p>Recently I found out Microsoft's Visual Studio doesn't support alternative tokens (ie "and" instead of "&amp;&amp;"). Even worse than that, apparently they don't think it's even necessary. And by the looks of <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/751842/alternative-tokens-dont-work">this thread</a>, the people working on MSVC need to take some time to actually READ the cpp standard. You know... it's kind of like a spec for your product. It's always good to take some time to understand the specs for your product...</p>
<p>I can only imagine how incredibly ugly their lexer must be to say it's not a fixable problem.</p>
