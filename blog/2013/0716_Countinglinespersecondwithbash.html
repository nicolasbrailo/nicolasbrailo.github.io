<h2>Counting lines per second with bash</h2>

Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2013-07-16 - <a href="/blog/2013/0716_Countinglinespersecondwithbash.html">Permalink</a> 

<p>The other day I wanted to quickly monitor the status of a production nginx after applying some iptables rules and changing some VPN stuff. It's easy to know if you completely screwed up the server: the number of requests per second will drop to zero, all requests will have an httpstatus different from 200, or some other dramatic and easy to measure side effect.</p>
<p>What happens if you broke something in a slightly more subtle way? Say, you screwed up something in ipsec (now, I wonder how that can happen...) and now networking is slow. Or iptables now enforces some kind of throttling in a way you didn't expect. To detect this type of errors I wrote a quick bash script to output how many lines per second are added to a file. This way I was able to monitor if the throughput of my nginx install didn't decrease after my config changes, without installing a full fledged solution like zabbix.</p>
<p>I didn't find anything like this readily available, so I'm posting it here in case someone else finds it useful.</p>
<pre lang="bash"><code class="language-bash" lang="bash">#!/bin/bash
# Time between checks
T=5
# argv[1] will be the file to check
LOG_FILE=$1
while true; do
    tmp=`mktemp`
    # tail a file into a temp. -n0 means don't output anything at the start so
    # we can sleep $T seconds and we don't need to worry about previous entries
    tail -n0 -f $LOG_FILE &gt; $tmp 2&gt;/dev/null &amp; sleep $T;
    kill $! &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
    echo "Requests in $LOG_FILE in the last $T seconds: `cat $tmp | wc -l`";
    rm $tmp;
done
