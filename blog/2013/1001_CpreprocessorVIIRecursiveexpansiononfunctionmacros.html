<div class="post">
<p>The last time we talked about recursive expansion rules on C's preprocessor: to sum it up, each expansion creates a scope, that contains a list of all macros which have already been expanded in said scope, or in a parent scope. That gives us a very nice and easy to understand tree of already-expanded rules.</p>
<p>Clearly that's too easy for C. We need more complexity: we need to make the expansion rules interact with the argument substitution process and the preprocessor operators too!</p>
<p>How exactly? The whole process is specified by a very tiny paragraph, 16.3.1, on the standard, which despite being tiny contains a lot of information. Actually, it contains all the expansion and precedence rules for the preprocessor. And it's more or less like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Argument scanning: the perprocessor binds a set of tokens to each argument name. If there are extra arguments and the token "..." is part of the macro's signature, a __VA_ARGS__ argument is created. (to put it simply: it will bind a set of tokens like "(a,b)" to an identifier like "ARG1").</li>
<li>Stringify and token pasting is applied ONLY to the arguments, not to the body function.</li>
<li>Each argument is recursively scanned for macro expansion, as if each argument was on a file on its own (imagine a new file is created with only preprocessor directives and the argument, then apply the expansion algorithm recursively to that file).</li>
<li>After the arguments have been fully expanded, they are substituted on the macro's body.</li>
<li>The resulting definition is then rescanned for macro expansions or token pasting operators.</li>
<li>A side effect of this multi-phase macro expansion is that the nice expansion tree we used to have no longer works.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's take this example:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">#define str(...) #<strong>VA_ARGS</strong>
#define foo(a, b) foo a bar str(b)
#define bar foo bar 1
foo(bar, (1, 2, 3))
</code></pre>
<p>How can we expand this macro call? Like this:</p>
<pre><code>expand{ foo(bar) }
        Match foo with definition of macro: foo(a)
            Bind a to bar
            Macro expand argument a -&gt; expand{ bar }
                    bar takes no arguments, no binding is done
                    Apply rule bar -&gt; foo bar 1
                    Scan the result for new expanions
                            foo was already expanded, no further expansion
            Bind b to (1, 2, 3)
            Macro expand argument b -&gt; nothing to expand
        Replace macro expanded arguments in body definition:
            -&gt; foo foo bar 1 bar str((1, 2, 3))
        Rescan the body for further expansion:
                foo: Already expanded on current scope
                foo: Already expanded on current scope
                bar: Already expanded (The compiler will have too keep a map of expanded macros for each identifier in a definition!)
                bar: Needs expansion
                        Apply rule bar -&gt; foo bar 1
                        Rescan for further expansion
                                foo: Already expanded on parent scope
                                bar: Already expanded on current scope
                str((1, 2, 3)): Expand macro call
                        Bind (1, 2, 3) to <strong>VA_ARGS</strong>
                            Analyze (1, 2, 3) for further expansion
                            Apply operator '#' to (1, 2, 3) -&gt; "(1, 2, 3)"
                        Replace #<strong>VA_ARGS</strong>
                Replace the result of str((1,2,3)) -&gt; "(1, 2, 3)"
        Replace the original call "foo(bar, (1, 2, 3))" for the result
            -&gt; foo foo bar 1 foo bar 1 "(1, 2, 3)"
</code></pre>
<p>This last example should be a good representative of the complexities involved in a macro expansion; hopefully now you know more than you ever wanted to know about macros.</p>
