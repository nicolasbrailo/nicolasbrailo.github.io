<h1>Five years<a name="fiveyears"></a></h1>
<p>It's been a while since I've used the meta-post category. I think it's a good opportunity to do so: exactly five years ago I typed "/./etc/init.d/blog start", on this same blog. Quite a long time.</p>
<p>I'm really surprised I've managed to keep on writing more or less regularly for five years on this blog. There are now about 360 articles on this site, which gives an average of about one per week. That's a nice metric, even if not very accurate. I spent almost a year without writing, while moving to a different country. Maybe I should start a blog about that too.</p>
<p>Here's for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWm03wYBTbM">five years</a> more!</p>
