<h1>Learning misspells: thanks Vim!<a name="learningmisspellsthanksvim"></a></h1>
<p>I just noticed a very silly "pattern" I usually fall into: since I like vim (perhaps a bit too much) to work with text, even free-form text like this blog post, most of the times I type a lot of text which then must be spell checked (so far I haven't found a spell checking extension I like for vim). While spell checking I correct the original text in vim, and to do this I usually search for the mispel in Vim, thus typing the wrong spelling one more time. This has the side effect of reinforcing the bad spell instead of forcing me to type the correct spelling.</p>
<p>I wonder how can I fix this problem without a spellchecker for vim.</p>
