<h1>C preprocessor V: Conditionals<a name="cpreprocessorvconditionals"></a></h1>
<p>While walking around the c preprocessor we came to know the stringify operator, the crazy token pasting operator and a __VA_ARGS__ macro. All very weird, but at least the #if&rsquo;s work in a sane way&hellip; or do they? They do, but there&rsquo;s some room for unexpected behavior if you don&rsquo;t know some implementation details. Take this code for example:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">#if 0
#  if 0
#  else
#  elif true
#  endif
#endif
</pre>
<p>Clearly the inner if is wrong because the else clause comes before the elseif, however you might think it doesn&rsquo;t matter because it&rsquo;s surrounded by an #if 0. Surprise: it does matter, that&rsquo;s not valid preprocessor input. Even if the outer #if is not &ldquo;taken&rdquo;, whatever preprocessing directives are inside it should still be valid (though anything that&rsquo;s not a preprocessing directive will indeed be ignored).</p>
<p>Even though at first it might seem weird for things inside an #if 0 to be important, it makes sense if you think that should an internal #if not respect the proper structure then the preprocessor wouldn&rsquo;t know when to end the first #if 0. Then again, if you find any real-world utility to this bit of preprocessor implementation trivia, you are doing something horribly wrong!</p>
