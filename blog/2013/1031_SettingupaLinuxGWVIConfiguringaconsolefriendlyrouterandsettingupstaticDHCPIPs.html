<h1>Setting up a Linux GW VI: Configuring a console friendly router and<a name="settingupalinuxgwviconfiguringaconsolefriendlyrouterand"></a></h1>
<p>setting up static DHCP IPs</p>
<p>We have so far setup a device capable of working as a router for a medium sized LAN, providing NAT, DHCP and DNS services. This is great if you have a dedicated network admin, but you may prefer something easier for casual console users. We&rsquo;ll see how to &ldquo;refactor&rdquo; your server configuration now to make it more console friendly.</p>
<h3>Moving DHCP config files<a name="movingdhcpconfigfiles"></a></h3>
<p>Since I want to keep everything together for easy administration, I will move the configuration files for DHCP to /home/router/dhcp. Changing the dhcpd.conf file itself is easy, just move the subnets declarations and add this line:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">include &quot;/home/router/dhcp/subnets.conf&quot;;
include &quot;/home/router/dhcp/static_hosts.conf&quot;;
</pre>
<p>Like we did before with bind, we need to configure apparmor. vim /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.dhcpd and add this two lines:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">/home/router/dhcp/ rw,
/home/router/dhcp/** rw,
</pre>
<p>Restart apparmor service, then restart dhcpd. Everything should work just fine.</p>
<h3>Setting up static IPs<a name="settingupstaticips"></a></h3>
<p>Remember the static_hosts file we created before? We can use that to define a static IP. Add the following to set a static IP host:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">host HostName {
    hardware ethernet 00:00:00:00:00:00
    fixed-address 192.168.10.50;
}
</pre>
<p>After that, just restart the DHCP service and renew your client&rsquo;s IP. Done, it&rsquo;s static now!</p>
<p>Wait a minute: how do you find the MAC for your host? I&rsquo;m to lazy to copy and type it, so I did the following:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">cd /home/router/dhcp
ln -s /var/lib/dhcp leases
</pre>
<p>Then you can check the hardware address in the leases/dhcpd.leases file. I created a symlink to keep this directory at hand, since it gives you a status of the current leases.</p>
