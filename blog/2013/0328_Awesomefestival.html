<h1>Awesome festival<a name="awesomefestival"></a></h1>
<p>I already had an awesome talking makefile which commanded me to go and fix my program when it broke by using festival, a voice synthesizer for Linux. I didn&rsquo;t know there was also a plugin for gaim, &ldquo;festival-gaim&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite funny but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good idea to have your computer reading out loud your messages. And you should remember to log off when going to sleep.</p>
<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;ll try festival as (yet another) wake up method: with a cron I can probably get it to read the news out loud in the morning. I&rsquo;m not sure yet if that&rsquo;ll wake me up or make me even sleepier, though.</p>
