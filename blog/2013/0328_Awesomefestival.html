<h1>Awesome festival<a name="awesomefestival"></a></h1>
<p>I already had an awesome talking makefile which commanded me to go and fix my program when it broke by using festival, a voice synthesizer for Linux. I didn't know there was also a plugin for gaim, "festival-gaim".</p>
<p>It's quite funny but I don't think it's a good idea to have your computer reading out loud your messages. And you should remember to log off when going to sleep.</p>
<p>Perhaps I'll try festival as (yet another) wake up method: with a cron I can probably get it to read the news out loud in the morning. I'm not sure yet if that'll wake me up or make me even sleepier, though.</p>
