<h2>No cloud IoT: LAN only Security camera<a name="nocloudiotlanonlysecuritycamera"></a></h2>
<p>Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2024-05-23 | <a href="/blog/2024/0523_NoCloudSecurityCam.html">Permalink</a>  | <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/nicolasbrailo.github.io/issues/new?title=Comment@/blog/2024/0523_NoCloudSecurityCam.html&amp;body=I%20have%20a%20comment!">Leave a comment</a></p>
<p>A while back I spent some time setting up a security camera/doorbell. I wanted to have a camera that</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires no external vendor connection: I must be able to run it locally, forever, with or without Internet.</li>
<li>I can monitor on real time, ideally with my phone.</li>
<li>notifies me when the doorbell button is pressed (integrating with the Sonos speakers throughout my home).</li>
<li>triggers an event when motion is detected, so I can integrate it with other systems.</li>
<li>stores videos on a disk when there is motion, so I can review them later.</li>
<li>will send me a message when I'm out of home and motion is detected.</li>
</ul>
<p>The process required a lot of trial and error, guessing arcane commands from poor documentation or from random (often decade-old, unmaintained) open source projects. I figured I should document my setup.</p>
<h2>tl;dr<a name="tldr"></a></h2>
<p>This article ended up being a lot longer than I expected, so if you're here for the short version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reolink makes cameras that are easy to integrate with and require no cloud</li>
<li>
<p>Here's an <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/reolink_aio/tree/ec2469fe45bb4f050900a7bb8d23f51c2bbd6da2/examples/reolink_onvif_subscription">example of how to subscribe and process camera events</a>, like motion detection or doorbell presses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any sane camera will stream over RTSP. Once you find the RTSP URL, you can test it with ffmepg: <code>ffmpeg -i $rtsp_url, -c:v copy -c:a copy $outpath</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I built a <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/zigbee2mqtt2web/blob/master/zigbee2mqtt2web_extras/reolink_cam/nvrish.py">hacky galery for stored RTSP streams</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And also send <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/PyTelegramBot">copies of the video over Telegram</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sourcing a camera<a name="sourcingacamera"></a></h2>
<p>I went for Reolink. After a lot of reading (and a few months of usage, now) it's a very good option in its price range (cheap). They seem to have a good range of cameras, and all the features I was looking for: LAN-first, streaming, motion events, power-over-ethernet and a decent enough admin interface. Besides a very good range of PTZ (pan-tilt-zoom) cams, they also have a PoE a doorbell, which closed the deal for me.</p>
<p>PoE, again: Can't recommend PoE enough: there's no Wifi fighting, and if things get wonky you just ask the switch to cycle the port. You probably already need to run a cable for power, so why not do it for eth instead, and get both in one?</p>
<p>I would love a camera with open source firmware, but I figured if I spent my time tinkering with cam firmware, I would have never actually got the time to integrate it with my IoT network - so maybe a project for the far off future, when I have finished absolutely everything else on my ToDo list. As it is, I decided it's an acceptable trade-off to have an untrusted closed-source firmware running in my network, placed in an isolated vlan without internet access (it's not the only untrusted device I run in my network, and I admit not all of them live in vlans...)</p>
<h2>Talking to the camera<a name="talkingtothecamera"></a></h2>
<p>There is a protocol called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONVIF">ONVIF</a>". Wikipedia claims it hails from the dark ages of the late 2000's, and it has an XML based transport to prove it. ONVIF is meant to be a standard way to discover how an IP camera works, but, like most XML-based protocols turned out to be in practice, is extremely verbose, requires you to traverse countless schema definition files to understand it, and it's quite hard to parse. Of course most cameras I've seen seem to implement ONVIF either partially or with non-standard extensions, making the whole design idea around the XML schema quite pointless anyway.</p>
<p>Reolink cams also support an HTTP/Json REST-like API, which makes things a lot easier. The HTTP interface is simple to inspect and understand by looking at the admin page with a browser's dev tools. Unfortunately, not everything is exposed through their HTTP API, so a bit of ONVIF digging may be necessary. Most notably, in the version of the firmware I tried, it's not possible to configure the camera to talk back to a server when events happen - which is quite important if you intend to use it as a doorbell.</p>
<p>There is an <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/reolink_aio">open source project that translates most of the Reolink HTTP commands to python</a>. This project makes it very easy to replicate the functionality of the admin interface, but with a Python API. This project should cover 99% of all basic usage. Using this project, you can do things like <code>cam.doorbell_led</code> to set up the LED state. Most importantly, <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/zigbee2mqtt2web/blob/master/zigbee2mqtt2web_extras/reolink_cam/__init__.py#L77">it will take care of the login flow for you</a>, which is quite tedious to implement using raw requests.</p>
<h2>Getting the camera to talk back to us<a name="gettingthecameratotalkbacktous"></a></h2>
<p>Note <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/reolink_aio">the project I linked above is actually a fork</a>. The original project exists pretty much solely to integrate with HomeAssistant, and it's not too ~~user~~developer-friendly if what you're looking for is a way to configure a camera to talk back to a server. Since my most important goal was to use a camera as a doorbell, the first requirement was getting some sort of notification when the doorbell button is pressed.</p>
<p>Reolink cams can announce events back to a URL (<a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/zigbee2mqtt2web/blob/master/zigbee2mqtt2web_extras/reolink_cam/__init__.py#L92C11-L92C37">as simple as <code>cam.subscribe(webhook_url)</code></a>), but they will do so in an ONVIF format. There is a standalone example of how to <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/reolink_aio/tree/ec2469fe45bb4f050900a7bb8d23f51c2bbd6da2/examples/reolink_onvif_subscription">subscribe to ONVIF notifications, and how to parse them, over here</a>.</p>
<p>In the example above, there is a Flask server printing a Json version of the ONVIF message. For Reolink cams, it prints the state of the camera (either motion detected, or doorbell button pressed) in a human-friendly Json format. I found the latency to be less than a second for the doorbell press event. The motion detection events, and the AI people detection events, also seem to trigger with low latency, but you'll need to tweak the config to suite your environment; if there is lots of movement in your street, it can be quite noisy.</p>
<h2>Streaming<a name="streaming"></a></h2>
<p>Streaming is easy! Reolink has an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-Time_Streaming_Protocol">RTSP</a> link. RTSP is an UDP based protocol that will transport media from a streaming device to another (and you likely use it every day, whenever you make a VoIP call). It's also lightweight, relatively sane, and comes to us from the late 90's (I wonder what happened between the 90's and 10's that gave us XML based protocols).</p>
<p>The RTSP link will be something like <code>rtsp://$user:$pass@$cam_ip:554/h264Preview_01_main</code>, but it's <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/zigbee2mqtt2web/blob/master/zigbee2mqtt2web_extras/reolink_cam/__init__.py#L92C11-L92C37">easier to ask the camera</a>. There are different stream URLs, depending on the camera model, supported codecs, etc, so a little bit of trial and error may be required.</p>
<p>To test an RTSP URL, <a href="https://www.videolan.org/">VLC</a> is 80% likely to work. I found it, however, quite hard to debug failures using VLC. There may be codec mismatches, missing libraries, connection failures, or other random problems - and VLC it would just say "nope". This is usually good enough for most users, there is not too much a "normal" user can do on an RTSP setup failure. We are, however, not normal, so we use <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a>:</p>
<pre><code>ffmpeg -i $rtsp_url, -c:v copy -c:a copy $outpath
</code></pre>
<p>This magic ffmpeg incantation will connecto to an RTSP URL and copy the incoming audio and video streams to a file, without any re-encoding (by default ffmpeg will try to reencode and spend tons of cpu on it). If everything goes fine, you'll end up with an mpeg of your camera. If it doesn't, ffmpeg will usually print a developer friendly (ish) error message.</p>
<p>Of course once we found a working RTSP URL we wouldn't want to use ffmpeg just to check who's at the door. For that, I found <a href="https://github.com/penguin86/ojo">Ojo works amazingly well</a>. It's an RTSP viewer for Android, available in <a href="https://f-droid.org/is/packages/it.danieleverducci.ojo/">F-Droid and probably other app stores</a>.</p>
<h2>NVR-like service<a name="nvrlikeservice"></a></h2>
<p>If you can see an RTSP stream, you can also save to disk. In fact that's exactly what we did to test it, with ffmpeg. <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/zigbee2mqtt2web/blob/master/zigbee2mqtt2web_extras/reolink_cam/ffmpeg_helper.py">My custom Reolink integration</a> has an ffmpeg helper; whenever motion is reported by the camera, it will save a copy of the RTSP stream to disk. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>we rely on the camera to report movement, so there can be false positives, and false negatives. You'll need to figure out how well the camera motion detection algorithms work for you.</li>
<li>by only recording when the camera reports movement, we save a ton of disk space and CPU: no need to record when 99% of the day there is no motion. I like keeping my electricity bill down.</li>
<li>but we miss the first few seconds of movement. By the time the camera triggers a motion alert, the RTSP is set up, and we start recording, it's likely that more than a few seconds have passed.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know if this is how real NVR services behave: my IoT network is built for fun, and since I have fun coding, I don't always spend a lot of time looking into already-built services. I didn't immediately find an open source NVR-like service that worked as I wanted, so I quickly hacked one based on ffmpeg and some <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/zigbee2mqtt2web/blob/master/zigbee2mqtt2web_extras/reolink_cam/nvrish.py">hacky Flask to create a gallery for the stored videos</a>.</p>
<h2>Telegram integration<a name="telegramintegration"></a></h2>
<p>By now, I had a camera integrated into a system that </p>
<ul>
<li>I can monitor on real time, using RTSP</li>
<li>notifies me when the doorbell button is pressed</li>
<li>triggers an event when motion is detected</li>
<li>stores videos on a disk when there is motion</li>
</ul>
<p>I was only missing IM notifications. I used <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/PyTelegramBot">Telegram for this, with a custom built integration</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/BatiCasa/blob/main/notifications.py#L140">notifications will trigger</a> first when motion is detected, and it will send a still frame of the camera stream. Once the motion stops, it will reencode the video in a format that Telegram likes, and send it over too:</p>
<pre><code>ffmpeg -i $fpath -vf scale=640:360 -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset veryfast -c:a copy $out_path
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately this integration seems to trigger some spam control in Telegram, and got my account banned. I recommend sending pictures only, that seems to be more acceptable to Telegram's term of service.</p>

<h2>Raspberry Pi UART debug notes<a name="raspberrypiuartdebugnotes"></a></h2>
<p>Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2024-05-19 | <a href="/blog/2024/0519_RaspberryPiUARTNotes.html">Permalink</a>  | <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/nicolasbrailo.github.io/issues/new?title=Comment@/blog/2024/0519_RaspberryPiUARTNotes.html&amp;body=I%20have%20a%20comment!">Leave a comment</a></p>
<p>I spent a bit of time setting up UARTs to troubleshoot different Raspberry Pis. Here are my notes.</p>
<h2>Electrical config<a name="electricalconfig"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Get a UART to USB adapter. I got one called "UART-TTL USB Adapter with CH340G Converter for 3.3 V" for less than $5. This one comes with 5 pins: 3.3v, 5v, tx, rx, gnd. For Rpi's UART, we'll ignore the two Vcc pins, we just need tx, rx and gnd. The adapter needs to run at 3.3v for an Rpi.</li>
<li>Connect GND=Rpi pin 6, RX adapter = Rpi pin 8 (GPIO14/TXD), TX adapter = Rpi pin 10 (GPIO15/RXD). Remember that tx and rx need to be inverted: tx in the adapter should be plugged to rx in the Rpi - See <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html">here for a pinout map</a>.</li>
<li>UART is simple, but very sensitive to the quality of the electrical connection. Flaky connection leads to poor connectivity, and poor connectivity leads to lost bits. Really bad connections will come out garbled and impossible to read (probably not resembling text). Bad-but-not-terrible connections will appear broken, but legible (eg with missing characters). If the connection is flaky, try a different ground pin in the RPI (for example, you can switch GND to pin 39). You can also try a different USB hub.</li>
<li>The adapter I got has an LED light for the TX path, and another for the RX path. This is very helpful to figure out if the connection is good (a bad connection results in a dim LED, or in both LEDs lighting up). It also helps detect when TX/RX are swapped.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Raspberry Pi config<a name="raspberrypiconfig"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>echo "enable_uart=1" &gt; /boot/firmware/config.txt (Or change in the sd card).</li>
<li>In a (booted) Rpi: <code>rpi-eeprom-config</code>, then set <code>BOOT_UART=1</code> - this may not work in Raspberry Pis Zeros.</li>
<li>Adding <code>uart_2ndstage=1</code> in config.txt should <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1301">help get bootloader logs</a>.</li>
<li>Don't forget to configure the Kernel: <code>console=serial0,115200</code> should be in your cmdline.txt (it's set by default nowadays).</li>
<li>If you are troubleshooting boot issues, <code>bootcode_delay=3</code> and <code>boot_delay=3</code> should add 3 seconds of <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/legacy_config_txt.html">delay between bootloaders</a>.</li>
<li>init_uart_baud can <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#part3.1">tweak UART speed</a>, but shouldn't be needed unless your connection is very flaky and you can't fix it for some reason.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other things in config.txt that may or may not help. Here's mine:</p>
<pre><code>enable_uart=1
dtparam=uart0=on
uart_2ndstage=1
hdmi_force_hotplug=1
config_hdmi_boost=4
bootcode_delay=3
boot_delay=3
</code></pre>
<h2>Test run<a name="testrun"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Connect the adapter before power on the target, to get boot logs. The adapter should appear as /dev/ttyUSB0 or similar (tail dmesg to confirm)</li>
<li>Monitor UART with <code>sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200</code> (115200 seems to be the default speed in Rpi, configured as a kernel param in cmdline.txt)</li>
<li>Exit screen with <code>C-A \</code></li>
<li>If you don't like screen, minicom is nicer (scrollback works better with tmux, out of the box): <code>sudo minicom --device /dev/ttyUSB0</code></li>
<li>Exit minicom with <code>C-A x</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Extra tip: Unlike their bigger brothers, Raspberry Pi Zeros don't seem to want to boot up with no SD card in, not even to show a bootloader error.</p>
<h2>Example<a name="example"></a></h2>
<p>If everything worked well, you should see either boot logs (if the UART was connected before power on) or a login screen. Here's an example of the first few seconds of my Rpi booting:</p>

<p>If a Raspberry Pi boots but has no HDMI signal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add <code>hdmi_force_hotplug=1</code> to /boot/firmware/config.txt - this forces the Pi to send HDMI video even if it thinks there's no monitor connected.</li>
<li>Add <code>config_hdmi_boost=4</code> to /boot/firmware/config.txt - this tweaks the HDMI signal strength.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, remove all possible adapters (each will add a bit of noise and attenuation) and get a cable with good shielding.</p>

<p>Weekend project: made my boiler Zigbee compatible, bypassing a Drayton heating thermostat. I'm quite proud of the final results:</p>
<p><a href="/blog_img/zigbeeboiler01.jpg"><img alt="" src="/blog_img/zigbeeboiler01.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>On the left, the wiring; on the right, the control panel. <strong>Disclaimer: this note shows an experiment. Don't take any electrical advise from this text.</strong></p>
<p>For a few years, I've been using <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/zigbee2mqtt2web">my own home automation system</a>, developed almost from scratch. I should write about it some day (tl;dr, it was a fun weekend project that turned into multiple, mostly fun, weekend projects). Something missing from my home automation was heating integration, which is especially sad given I have Zigbee temperature sensors everywhere. With the winter over I spent a weekend working on making my boiler Zigbee compatible (wouldn't want an expensive emergency visit in the middle of winter to repair my boiler).</p>
<p>My boiler uses a Drayton thermostat as a control, which seems very common in the UK (n=3). They seem mostly used as an on/off switch (OpenTherm isn't very common here), so there's no reason I couldn't bypass it with a relay while keeping the normal thermostat as a backup. Both the installation manual and the back of my control unit confirm this:</p>
<p><a href="/blog_img/zigbeeboiler02.jpg"><img alt="" src="/blog_img/zigbeeboiler02.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The heating-on signal is just closing the circuit between two terminals. For good measure, I decided to check this with a volt-meter (which, by the way, I strongly recommend against; unlike attaching a probe to a running program with gdb, probing a live circuit can be a shocking experience).</p>
<p>Once I was triple sure the chances of sparks and magic smoke where low, I got a 1 channel Zigbee relay module (220v, dry, 5 amps); if you are reading this guide for inspiration, make sure your switch can handle more power than your fuse. You don't want random electrical equipment acting as a fuse for your fuse. Also look for a "dry" relay, to keep power supply and control circuits separate, and needless to say it should handle 220V. I went for a "MHCOZY Tuya Dry Contact Zigbee Relay Switch Module,1 Channel AC 100-240V" - there are a few like these and they all seem to be the same whitelabel Zigbee element.</p>
<p><a href="/blog_img/zigbeeboiler03.jpg"><img alt="" src="/blog_img/zigbeeboiler03.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>A picture of the wiring; the connection needs to be parallel to the existing controller, to keep both working.</p>
<p>The control logic lives in my <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/zigbee2mqtt2web/blob/master/zigbee2mqtt2web_extras/heating/rules.py">monolithic home automation repo</a>, as a set of configurable Python rules, and while I've only had a few cold days to try them out, they seem to work. Next winter I'll be able to control my thermostat remotely from my <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/PyTelegramBot">Telegram bot</a>, while I take a holiday to the beach.</p>

<p>I try to back up all my online accounts, in case a provider ceases to exist, or one of my accounts is banned for (unknowingly) breaking terms-of-service. The other day I figured I wasn't doing that with Github, so I wrote <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Nico.rc/blob/master/github.backup.sh">a script to back up all my (or any user's) repos automatically</a>. The gist is:</p>
<pre lang="bash"><code class="language-bash" lang="bash">wget -q "https://api.github.com/users/$USER/repos" -O- &gt; idx.json
for repo in $( cat idx.json | jq '.[].ssh_url' ); do
  git clone --recurse-submodules "$repo"
done
</code></pre>
<p>This will clone all <em>PUBLIC</em> repos to a local computer, from which you can tar.gz and upload to your preferred archive medium.</p>

<h2>Bash ',' is a legal function name, and a perfect prefix<a name="bashisalegalfunctionnameandaperfectprefix"></a></h2>

<p>If you have a set of <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Nico.rc">miscellaneous Bash-helpers</a> that you frequently use, you probably want some sort of namespace for easy access. For example, prepending the name of all your helpers with "myHelper-" is a good way of getting autocomplete to show only the relevant helpers you need. "myHelper-" is too much typing, though.</p>
<p>Unless your distro is extremely minimal, all the letters in Bash are taken and you can't have an unambiguous single-letter "namespace". You need to look beyond letters: ',' is a ferpectly legal Bash name. You can prefix all your helpers with ',' for easy and quick autocomplete. An example <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Nico.rc/blob/master/bash/android.sh">from my bashrc</a>:</p>
<pre lang="bash"><code class="language-bash" lang="bash">function ,alogcat() {
  local MAYBE_TEE
  MAYBE_TEE="$1"
  adb logcat -c
  if [ -z "${MAYBE_TEE}" ]; then
    adb logcat
  else
    adb logcat | tee "$MAYBE_TEE"
  fi
}
function ,a-screen-off() {
  adb shell input keyevent 26
}
</code></pre>
<p>With this, I can type <code>,a</code> to get an autocomplete of just my Android helpers.</p>

<p>If you find the native client for Spotify is too cluttered, <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Spotiweb">Spotiweb</a> can provide a simpler experience. <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Spotiweb">Spotiweb</a> automatically goes through the list of your followed artists to create an index groupped by category. The categories will be automatically determined based on the artists you follow. The result will be a simple web page with an index of all the artists you followed, groupped by somewhat logical categories (when categories exist).</p>
<p><img alt="SpotiWeb running looks like this" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolasbrailo/SpotiWeb/master/screenshot.png" /></p>
<p>You can use this service from <a href="https://nicolasbrailo.github.io/SpotiWeb/">nicolasbrailo.github.io/SpotiWeb</a> - you will need a developer API key+secret. All the storage is local to your browser (there is no key, user data or anything at all being sent to any external host, everything is done in your browser) and you can even use this client offline (Spotify won't work offline, though). You can also self-host this service, either by forking the project or by running it via a local webserver.</p>
<p>This is a utility that grew somewhat organically from a simple index of artists; as more and more features of the native client got broken in my different setups, the web app "grew" to replace it. Today it's pretty much a full-fledged web-app capable of replacing the native client entirely, able to play music using Spotify's web sdk, integrate with the native client (if one is available) and with local speakers in your network.</p>

<p>Linux audio isn't friendly, even if pipewire is making huge strides in making it "just work". If you ever find you need to get down to the ALSA level, something is probably very broken. If (when) this happens, and you can't figure out which of your ALSA cards you should be using, just try them all:</p>
<pre lang="bash"><code class="language-bash" lang="bash">set -euo pipefail
if [ -z "${1+x}" ] || [ ! -f "${1}" ]; then
  echo "Will iterate over all known PCMs to try to capture or play audio and report which work"
  echo "Usage: $0 PLAYABLE_FILE"
  exit 1
fi
sample=${1}
plays_pcms=$( aplay --list-pcms | grep ':CARD=' )
for dev in $plays_pcms; do
  aplay --duration=1 --device="$dev" "$sample" 1&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; \
    echo "Playback may work on interface '$dev'"
done
cap_pcms=$( arecord --list-pcms | grep ':CARD=' )
for dev in $cap_pcms; do
  arecord --rate 48000 -f S16_LE --disable-resample --duration=1 --device="$dev" \
      /dev/null 1&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; \

<p>I (re?)learned a thing today: Vim can wget a site!</p>
<p>Doing <code>c-w gf</code> tells Vim to open whatever path is under the cursor. This is usually something like "#include <foo/bar/baz.h>", which means it will ask Vim to open <code>foo/bar/baz.h</code>. If you happen to have <code>http://nicolasbrailo.github.io</code> under your cursor, you'll be fetching this site into a temp buffer, in Vim.</p>
<h2>Bonus tip:<a name="bonustip"></a></h2>
<p>If <code>c-w gf</code> isn't finding the files you want it to, you may need to set your search path:</p>
<pre lang="vim"><code class="language-vim" lang="vim">set path+=/home/user/path/to/foo,/home/user/src/bar

<p>Another one to file in the category of self reminders, and a cheatsheet I'll need this weekend: whenever I need to work on the main (eth!) connection of a server, instead of grabbing a keyboard and a monitor it's easier to connect to wifi. For example, when I need to change the IP of a Raspberry PI in my network. Note this guide assumes a Debian-like environment:</p>
<pre lang="bash"><code class="language-bash" lang="bash"># Figure out which interfaces exist
ip a
# Figure out which interfaces are connected
ip link show
# For example:
ip link show wlp3s0
</code></pre>
<p>Restart the interface (which will do nothing, because it's probably not autoconfigurable)</p>
<pre><code>ip link set wlp3s0 down
ip link set wlp3s0 up
</code></pre>
<p>Start <code>wpa_cli</code>. Creating a new network may be needed, but I don't have notes. Once a network is created, its config will be in <code>/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</code>. Then:</p>
<pre lang="bash"><code class="language-bash" lang="bash">$ wpa_cli
&gt; scan
[Wait a few seconds]
&gt; scan_results
&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Connect:</p>
<pre lang="bash"><code class="language-bash" lang="bash"># Connect
wpa_supplicant -B -i wlp3s -c &lt; $( wpa_passphrase "your ssid name" "password" )
# Request IP
dhclient wlp3s0
# Confirm connection
ip addr show wlp3s0
</code></pre>
<p>Work on main interface (leave on a loop, in case wifi disconnects for whatever reason)</p>
<pre lang="bash"><code class="language-bash" lang="bash">while true; do dhclient -r eno1 ; dhclient eno1 ; ip addr show eno1; sleep 1; echo "DONE"; done
</code></pre>
<p>When done, kill wifi</p>
<pre lang="bash"><code class="language-bash" lang="bash">ip link set wlp3s0 down
# Release addr locally
dhclient -r wlp3s0
# To be sure:
rfkill
</code></pre>
