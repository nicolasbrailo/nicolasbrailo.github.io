<h1>Quick refresher: argument dependent lookup<a name="quickrefresherargumentdependentlookup"></a></h1>
<p>Since I wasted a few precious minutes stuck on an ADL problem, I figured I needed a quick reminder on how they work. Check this code: does it compile?</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">namespace N {
    int foo() {
    }
}
int main() {
    return foo();
}
</pre>
<p>Of course it doesn't! You'd expect a 'foo' not declared/out of scope error from your compiler. What about this other example?</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">namespace N {
    struct Dummy;
    int foo(Dummy<em>) {
        return 0;
    }
    int foo() {
    }
}
int main() {
    return foo((N::Dummy</em>)0);
}
</pre>
<p>You'd be tempted to say it won't work either. (Un?)fortunately, 'argument dependant lookup' is a thing, and the second code sample works. How? The compiler will look for 'foo' in the global namespace, and also in the namespace of the arguments to 'foo'. Seeing 'N::Dummy' in there, the compiler is allowed to peak into the namespace N for method 'foo'. Why? Short: operator overloading.
