<h1>Vim multiple search<a name="vimmultiplesearch"></a></h1>
<p>I keep forgetting about this one. Maybe writing it down will help me remember: Vim can search for (and highlight) multiple patterns at the same time. Just start your search with \v and split the patterns with |. Eg:</p>
<pre style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">:/\vfoo|bar
</pre>
