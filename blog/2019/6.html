<h1>The bestest autocomplete for Vim<a name="thebestestautocompleteforvim"></a></h1>
<p>By Nico Brailovsky @ 2019-06-11</p>
<p>TL;DR: I like <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe">YouCompleteMe</a>
A <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19529557">post in Hacker News</a> drew me to look at autocompletion in Vim. After trying a few plugins years before, I settled for the available-by-default autocomplete in Vim. It&rsquo;s pretty dumb, but pretty dumb covers 90% of what I need: autocompletionForReallyUglyOrLongNames.</p>
<p>Vim&rsquo;s omnifunc completer is enough if no fancy features are necessary: fast, available, trivial to setup. I have successfully used omnifunc in fairly large projects, and while it requires familiarity with the codebase, some may argue that&rsquo;s a feature and not a bug.</p>
<p>Now I confess: I don&rsquo;t understand Vundle, Pathogen or any other Vim plugin handler. Second extravagant opinion in this post: I don&rsquo;t see the point of a plugin manager for Vim. I like knowing the source code of every plugin I use well enough so I can troubleshoot it when it breaks (*). I prefer to #include (or, rather, source) them manually. Keeping <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Nico.rc">everything in Github</a>, I rarely need to set up a plugin twice. The effort to install and configure a plugin is usually not a lot more than learning how to use that plugin in the first place.</p>
<p>While being Vundle illiterate may have made my experience a bit more complicated than necessary, I still found the experience of installing autocompletion plugins quite horrible (#). <a href="https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim">Deoplete</a> had me chasing dependencies all over the place and Conquer of Completion seems to require such specific setup of version and plugins that I didn&rsquo;t even attempt to install it.</p>
<p>YouCompleteMe, though, was a pleasant surprise: its documentation explained how to install in three steps, and it is a mostly self-contained plugin. While YCM has a compiled dependency, setting it up is pretty trivial. It just works out of the box.</p>
<p>Took me years but I&rsquo;m very happy to finally find an autocomplete plugin that &ldquo;just works&rdquo; for my basic Vim setup.</p>
<p>(*) For some reason, I only feel this way about Vim</p>
<p>(#) Disclaimer: Re-reading my own text, it may appear as I&rsquo;m somewhat belittling Deoplete, CoC, Vundle, Pathogen, etc. That&rsquo;s not my intention. I have the maximum respect for these projects. The engineering effort in them is amazing, and I know for a fact they make life easier for a lot of people. I&rsquo;m just not one of them.</p>
