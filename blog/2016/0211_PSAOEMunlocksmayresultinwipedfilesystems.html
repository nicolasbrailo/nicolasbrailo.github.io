<h1>PSA: OEM unlocks may result in wiped filesystems<a name="psaoemunlocksmayresultinwipedfilesystems"></a></h1>
<p>o, I bricked my tablet. Turns out the bootloader couldn't mount /data: after doing an oem unlock thingy, /data gets wiped and (this is the part the manual I was following didn't warn me about) no filesys is created.</p>
<p>If this happens, go back to recovery mode, then adb shell and run 'mount /data'. This will give you an error like "Can't mount /dev/block/mmcblk0p23". Write down the /dev/block id and run 'mke2fs -t ext4 /dev/block/mmcblk0p30'. That should fix it.</p>
<p>In some systems you may be missing libext2_quota.so. If this happens, just look for libext2_quota.so in the interwebs, then adb push this file into /sbin.</p>
