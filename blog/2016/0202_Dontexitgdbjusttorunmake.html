<p>f you're more or less successful in your debugging session, it's quite likely that you'll have to modify some source code so you can actually fix a bug. And if you're more or less careful, you might want to validate your changes actually work. We saw some time ago that you don't need to restart gdb after a recompile because gdb is already smart enough to know that the binary changed.</p>
<p>Turns out you don't even need to drop from gdb to a shell: just type make (using the parameters you'd usually call make with) and watch gdb take care of building your binary again.</p>
<p>Rebuilding your project like this is not only useful to save time: you can also keep your breakpoints and they should still make sense, assuming you didn't refactor your code too much.</p>
