<h1>Don&rsquo;t exit gdb just to run make!<a name="dontexitgdbjusttorunmake"></a></h1>
<p>f you&rsquo;re more or less successful in your debugging session, it&rsquo;s quite likely that you&rsquo;ll have to modify some source code so you can actually fix a bug. And if you&rsquo;re more or less careful, you might want to validate your changes actually work. We saw some time ago that you don&rsquo;t need to restart gdb after a recompile because gdb is already smart enough to know that the binary changed.</p>
<p>Turns out you don&rsquo;t even need to drop from gdb to a shell: just type make (using the parameters you&rsquo;d usually call make with) and watch gdb take care of building your binary again.</p>
<p>Rebuilding your project like this is not only useful to save time: you can also keep your breakpoints and they should still make sense, assuming you didn&rsquo;t refactor your code too much.</p>
