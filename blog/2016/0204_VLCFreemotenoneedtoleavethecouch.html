<h1>VLCFreemote: no need to leave the couch<a name="vlcfreemotenoneedtoleavethecouch"></a></h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been quite prolific in my Github account recently, if I may say so myself. The latest of my open-source projects which I think is more or less ready to be &ldquo;released to the world&rdquo; is <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/VlcFreemote">VlcFreemote</a>, a remote control for VLC in Android. From its README file:</p>
<p>How many times have you been comfortably watching a movie from the couch only to find out you forgot the subtitles? How about being snugly tucked under a blanket, only to find out you need to brave the cold of winter just to add a new episode of your latest binge-watching series? Yeah, that can easily ruin your day.</p>
<p>Worry no more: with VlcFreemote you can now install a tiny Android app to control your VLC server.</p>
<p>FAQ:
* Another VLC remote? Why?There are a few VLC remote controls out there. I think this is the only once that&rsquo;s open source (not 100% sure). It has some nice extra features I haven&rsquo;t found in other remote controls too: bookmarks, automagic movie-skip (jump forward by a percentage of the file length, much more useful than it sounds!) a compact layout and other small things probably not even worth mentioning. In the future, whenever I get some free time, I&rsquo;d like to add the ability to start VLC automatically from SSH, a feature I would use a lot and I have seen nowhere else.
* Why isn&rsquo;t this in Google play?Mostly cause I&rsquo;m lazy and cheap. Getting a Google Play account costs 10 dollars or so, and I&rsquo;m too lazy and too cheap to get one. Want me to upload it to Google Play? Feel free to buy me a beer. If not you can just get the APK from Github, or download the source code and build it yourself.</p>
