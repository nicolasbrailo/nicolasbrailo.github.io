<h1>Goto hell<a name="gotohell"></a></h1>
<p>Small and funny easter egg I found by accident today: stop using "adb shell" to access your device. You're wasting precious keystrokes. Instead, you should be using "adb hell". Yes, 'adb hell' works just as well as 'adb shell' - but it's even more awesome. Go and try it!</p>
