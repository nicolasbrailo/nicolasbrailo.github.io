<h1>Goto hell<a name="gotohell"></a></h1>
<p>Small and funny easter egg I found by accident today: stop using &ldquo;adb shell&rdquo; to access your device. You&rsquo;re wasting precious keystrokes. Instead, you should be using &ldquo;adb hell&rdquo;. Yes, &lsquo;adb hell&rsquo; works just as well as &lsquo;adb shell&rsquo; - but it&rsquo;s even more awesome. Go and try it!</p>
