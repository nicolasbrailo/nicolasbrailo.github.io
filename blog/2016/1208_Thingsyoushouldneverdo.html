<h1>Things you should never do<a name="thingsyoushouldneverdo"></a></h1>
<p>I think I may start a new series in my &ldquo;Rants&rdquo; category: things you shouldn&rsquo;t do. First one: Never ever use &ldquo;strange&rdquo; characters on your wifi&rsquo;s AP name, where strange is defined as non-ascii. I made the huge mistake of choosing a name with an &ntilde; on it, then had to spend an entire evening hacking on a printer driver with no unicode support. No, I couldn&rsquo;t have changed the AP&rsquo;s name. That would have required me to physically connect a computer to my router, and I was too lazy to get up from the couch.</p>
