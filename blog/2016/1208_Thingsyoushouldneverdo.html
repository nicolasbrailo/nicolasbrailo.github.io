<h1>Things you should never do<a name="thingsyoushouldneverdo"></a></h1>
<p>I think I may start a new series in my "Rants" category: things you shouldn't do. First one: Never ever use "strange" characters on your wifi's AP name, where strange is defined as non-ascii. I made the huge mistake of choosing a name with an &ntilde; on it, then had to spend an entire evening hacking on a printer driver with no unicode support. No, I couldn't have changed the AP's name. That would have required me to physically connect a computer to my router, and I was too lazy to get up from the couch.</p>
