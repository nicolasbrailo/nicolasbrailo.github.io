<h1>Ubuntu 15.10: Ubuntu ME<a name="ubuntu15.10ubuntume"></a></h1>
<p>Warning: semi-useless rant ahead. TL;DR: Avoid Ubuntu 15.10 - it&rsquo;s the closest Linux has ever been to Windows ME.</p>
<p>I have been using Ubuntu for a while now. From the time when Canonical actually mailed real, physical CDs of the distro. So get of my lawn.</p>
<p>In all of my Linux years I have never, ever, had such a horrible installation experience as I did this weekend with Ubuntu 15.10. I may go as far as saying not even Windows ME was this horrible to install. I hit dozens of critical show-stopper bugs, from poor UEFI support to an installer that crashed when clicking &ldquo;Go back&rdquo;. And that&rsquo;s only the installation, don&rsquo;t get me started on the new KDE Plasma 5 desktop&hellip; (hint: my big desktop screen is NOT a phone. Swiping to login? Bad idea for a mouse).</p>
<p>A few hints for any other poor souls that made the fatal mistake of installing Ubuntu ME:
* UEFI? Say no. Get a different computer if you can. Try to set it in legacy mode if you can not.
* Try not to repartition and install Ubuntu on the same go. Even more so if you have UEFI. First install, then rearrange partitions with a live cd.
* If you get a few (or a few dozen) &ldquo;system crash notifications&rdquo; when starting up your GUI, check /var/crash. Delete everything from there.
* If you want Kubuntu, don&rsquo;t install Ubuntu and then apt-get install kubuntu-desktop. That&rsquo;s broken. If you want Kubuntu just get its install image.
* Don&rsquo;t install Kubuntu. Really, it&rsquo;s horrible and it crashes. (You though I called 15.10 Ubuntu ME for no reason?)
* Don&rsquo;t like Gnome? XFCE is usable and can be configured to look more or less like a sane version of KDE. It still crashes but at least it&rsquo;s quick to boot.
* If you get a disk check on every startup just disable it on fstab. No, it&rsquo;s not nice. I haven&rsquo;t found any other workarounds yet.</p>
<p>I have no idea when has Ubuntu gone so horribly bad, but I&rsquo;m not looking forward to installing any Ubuntu distro anytime soon. I wonder what Slackware looks like these days.</p>
<p>2016? Still not the year of the Linux desktop.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> XFCE is great&hellip; except it doesn&rsquo;t really support moving the mouse. Seems Ubuntu is having a nostalgic release and decided to introduce <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/701119/xfce-drag-and-drop-pointer-stuck-on-some-windows">old bugs from 2012</a>!</p>

 It is! Haven&rsquo;t you heard about &ldquo;Ubuntu-on-Windows&rdquo; yet?.. :)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what to think about the Ubuntu on Windows thing, since I don&rsquo;t use Windows. I did assume it was a 1st of April thing, since that&rsquo;s when I read it&hellip; maybe ubuntu 15.10 was just a huge 1st of April prank?</p>
