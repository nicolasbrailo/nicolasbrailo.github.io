<h1>Public service announcement: searching your terminal's output<a name="publicserviceannouncementsearchingyourterminalsoutput"></a></h1>
<p>Short tip today, but a life-changer one: you don't need to copy&amp;paste your terminal's scrollback to search on it, you can do it in place. At least in terminator that's possible (and I hear it's also doable in Gnome's default terminal application). Just press Ctrl+Shift+F. No more copy and pasting to vim!</p>
