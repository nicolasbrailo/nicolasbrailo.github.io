<h1>Public service announcement: searching your terminal&rsquo;s output<a name="publicserviceannouncementsearchingyourterminalsoutput"></a></h1>
<p>Short tip today, but a life-changer one: you don&rsquo;t need to copy&amp;paste your terminal&rsquo;s scrollback to search on it, you can do it in place. At least in terminator that&rsquo;s possible (and I hear it&rsquo;s also doable in Gnome&rsquo;s default terminal application). Just press Ctrl+Shift+F. No more copy and pasting to vim!</p>
