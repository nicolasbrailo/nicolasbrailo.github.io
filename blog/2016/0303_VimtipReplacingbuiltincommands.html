<h1>Vim tip: Replacing builtin commands<a name="vimtipreplacingbuiltincommands"></a></h1>
<p>If you spent a day <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Nico.rc/blob/master/vim/plugins/bettertabnew.vim">writting a cool new version of the &ldquo;tabnew&rdquo; Vim command</a>, you&rsquo;ll probably want it to be the default command used to open new tabs. Right?</p>
<p>Luckily, there&rsquo;s an easy way to replace built in commands with custom ones: cabbrev. cabbrev will do a textual replacement, so if you add &ldquo;cabbrev tabnew TabNew&rdquo; to your vimrc, eachtime you type &ldquo;tabnew&rdquo; it will be translated to TabNew.</p>
<p>Bonus tip: The command is actually, &ldquo;abbrev&rdquo;, not &ldquo;cabbrev&rdquo;. The &ldquo;c&rdquo; stands for command: it&rsquo;s telling Vim that you want the abbrev command applied in command mode. You can also use it as &ldquo;nabbrev&rdquo; to have it applied in normal mode. &ldquo;abbrev&rdquo; it&rsquo;s a nice way to correct common typos!</p>
