<h1>Vim tip: Replacing builtin commands<a name="vimtipreplacingbuiltincommands"></a></h1>
<p>If you spent a day <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Nico.rc/blob/master/vim/plugins/bettertabnew.vim">writting a cool new version of the "tabnew" Vim command</a>, you'll probably want it to be the default command used to open new tabs. Right?</p>
<p>Luckily, there's an easy way to replace built in commands with custom ones: cabbrev. cabbrev will do a textual replacement, so if you add "cabbrev tabnew TabNew" to your vimrc, eachtime you type "tabnew" it will be translated to TabNew.</p>
<p>Bonus tip: The command is actually, "abbrev", not "cabbrev". The "c" stands for command: it's telling Vim that you want the abbrev command applied in command mode. You can also use it as "nabbrev" to have it applied in normal mode. "abbrev" it's a nice way to correct common typos!</p>
