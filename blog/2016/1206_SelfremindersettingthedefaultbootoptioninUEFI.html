<h1>Self reminder: setting the default boot option in UEFI<a name="selfremindersettingthedefaultbootoptioninuefi"></a></h1>
<p>Bought a new laptop (*) and I&rsquo;m 100% sure I&rsquo;ll forget this if I don&rsquo;t put it here:</p>
<p>From http://askubuntu.com/questions/291905/how-can-i-make-ubuntu-the-default-boot-option-on-a-newer-laptop-uefi</p>
<p>To set Ubuntu as the default boot OS in a multi-OS setup (ie, dual boot Windows) with UEFI, goto Windows and exec (as admin) bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \EFI\ubuntu\grubx64.efi</p>
<p>Why am I using Windows, you may ask? I&rsquo;m still in the process of discovering which features will be broken and which hardware will work out of the box. So far I&rsquo;m actually quite surprised, with only the video card and the touchpad not working. Luckily bash doesn&rsquo;t use either of those. Who needs a mouse anyway?</p>
