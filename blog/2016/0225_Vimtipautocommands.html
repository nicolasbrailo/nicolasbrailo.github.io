<h1>Vim tip: autocommands<a name="vimtipautocommands"></a></h1>
<p>Whenever you find yourself thinking &ldquo;I wish Vim could do this automagically for me&rdquo;, you probably are thinking about autocommands. With autocommands, autocmd for short or au for lazy people, will let you tell Vim, &ldquo;Hey, use this callback when an event occurs&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The basic structure is pretty simple: &ldquo;autocmd Event FileType Action&rdquo;. So, for example, &ldquo;autocmd BufEnter *.txt call Rot13()&rdquo; would tell vim to set a callback on BufEnter, that is whenever you change buffers, for all *.txt files, which will rot13 your text. Feel free to use this for actually useful things, like spell checking or auto indenting.</p>
