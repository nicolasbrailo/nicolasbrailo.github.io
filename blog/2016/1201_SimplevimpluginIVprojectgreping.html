<h1>Simple vim plugin IV: project greping<a name="simplevimpluginivprojectgreping"></a></h1>
<p>I recently wrote about some of the utilities I created for my Vim setup. Using someone else&rsquo;s Vim scripts is not nearly as fun as writing your own, so I decided to also write a short summary on what it takes to get started writting Vim plugins. For this task, I decided to start with greping.</p>
<p>Greping can be improved a bit: if you do it a lot in a project, you might find it&rsquo;s useful to also grep the results themselves, to further refine your search. If you have your grep results in vim itself, that is trivial.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start hacking something in our .vimrc file. Try this:</p>
<pre lang="ruby" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">function! FG_Search()
    let needle = input(&quot;Search for: &quot;)
    tabnew
    setlocal buftype=nofile bufhidden=wipe nobuflisted noswapfile nowrap
    let grepbin = &#x27;grep -nri &#x27;
    let cmd = grepbin . &#x27; &quot;&#x27; . needle . &#x27;&quot; *&#x27;
    execute &#x27;$read !&#x27; . cmd
    setlocal nomodifiable
endfunction
map &lt;leader&gt;s :call FG_Search()&lt;CR&gt;
</pre>
<p>This function should be pretty clear: it will map <leader>s (in my case, &ldquo;,s&rdquo;) to FG_Search(). FG_Search will prompt the user for a term to grep, then search for it executing the command. In the end the results are written to a new tab, which is declared as a temp non-modifiable buffer.</p>
<p>Just paste that in your .vimrc and you&rsquo;re good to grep.</p>
<p><strong>Extra tip</strong>: integrate this with my fast grep cache and you have a nice and quick project search integration for vim that works even for very large projects with tools available in most default Linux installs.</p>
