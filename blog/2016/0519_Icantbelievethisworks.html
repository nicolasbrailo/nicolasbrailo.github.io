<p>Are you bored? Try pasting this, as is, in a cpp file:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">// What is going on here??/
Is this even legal C++??/
Yes, it is!
</pre>
<p>NB: You may have to use -trigraphs to compile this. Try it out! You can use this command:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">echo -e &quot;// What is going on here??/Is this legal C++?&quot; | g++ -E -c -trigraphs -
</pre>
<p>With some luck, this won&rsquo;t be legal C++ anymore after C++ 17 deprecates trigraphs.</p>
