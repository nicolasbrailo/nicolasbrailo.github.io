<p>Who hasn't written some read-only magical Bash voodoo, only to find you need to decrypt your own creation later on? Luckily, <a href="http://explainshell.com/">Explain Shell</a> can help with that. Here's an example from my .bash_history file:</p>
<pre lang="bash"><code lang="bash">for fn in *; do echo cat $fn | sed "s|' '$URL'||g" | sed "s|curl -X POST -d '||g" ; done
</code></pre>
<p>And <a href="http://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=for+fn+in+*%3B+do+echo+cat+%24fn+%7C+sed+%22s%7C%27+%27%24URL%27%7C%7Cg%22+%7C+sed+%22s%7Ccurl+-X+POST+-d+%27%7C%7Cg%22+%3B+done">Explain Shell's</a> explanation: it's no substitute for knowing Bash but it sure helps.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: while reading my bash history file, I realized I accidentally copy&amp;paste a lot of code to my terminals. There are way too many "template <FOO>" entries in there...</p>
<p><strong>Bonus II</strong>: It's a good thing they wrote "shell" in a different color. I was wondering why I had "explains hell" in my bookmarks.</p>

<p>I'm still not over the disappointment from my latest Ubuntu install but recently I found a bug which is quite remarkable: <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1</a></p>
<p>Yes, Ubuntu's #1 bug, reported by Shuttleworth himself, is "Microsoft too big". I'm not too sure I agree with the bug's resolution.</p>

<p>I just noticed KSnapshot is smart. Too smart. If you save a snapshot to a folder with a bunch of files like "Snapshot_N_foo" it'll name the next one "Snapshot_N+1_foo". That already makes my computer smarter than some humans!</p>

<p>Are you bored? Try pasting this, as is, in a cpp file:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code lang="c++">// What is going on here??/
Is this even legal C++??/
Yes, it is!
</code></pre>
<p>NB: You may have to use -trigraphs to compile this. Try it out! You can use this command:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code lang="c++">echo -e "// What is going on here??/Is this legal C++?" | g++ -E -c -trigraphs -
</code></pre>
<p>With some luck, this won't be legal C++ anymore after C++ 17 deprecates trigraphs.</p>

<p>Tinkering with Firefox' JS console I had to copypaste some stuff. I got a really nice surprise when it wouldn't let me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scam Warning: Take care when pasting things you don't understand. This could allow attackers to steal your identity or take control of your computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's some really good advice coming from your browser's console.</p>

<p>Isn't it awful when you have to share a file too big for email and don't know how? You'd think by 2016 we'd have that figured out. Actually we do, many times over. Just pick a standard that works for you!</p>
<p>If you don't want to read many pages on file transfer standards (Samba? What's that?) you can try this little snippet:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code lang="c++">python -m SimpleHTTPServer $PORT
</code></pre>
<p>This will create an http server sharing the current directory. HTTP, luckily, is one of those things that tend to work everywhere, always.</p>

<h1>Initialization oddities: Aggregate initialization<a name="initializationodditiesaggregateinitialization"></a></h1>

<p>Do you know the quickest way to create a constructor that initializes the elements in this struct?</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code lang="c++">#include <string>
struct MyStruct {
    int x;
    std::string y;
    const char *z;
};
</code></pre>
<p>If you answered "by typing really fast", you may be interested in knowing that the fastest way to create this constructor is to not write it at all!</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code lang="c++">MyStruct a = {42, "Hello", "World"};
</code></pre>
<p>Yes, the line above works and it's perfectly legal C++. It's event C++ 98! This language feature is called aggregate initialization and it says the compiler should be smart enough to initialize MyStruct using each value successively. Of course C++11 has made this syntax somewhat simpler and a lot more uniform:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code lang="c++">MyStruct a{42, "Hello", "World"};
</code></pre>
<p>There are some caveats when using this initialization, namely that the initialized type must be an aggregate. An aggregate, in standard lingo, is a type that has some restrictions. No virtuals, no privates, etc. You can say it's a POD and in most cases you'd be right.</p>
<p>Now, is this also legal?</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code lang="c++">MyStruct a = {42, "Hello"};
</code></pre>
<p>You'd be tempted to say that's a syntax error. It's not, now z will just be default-initialized. What about this, then?</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code lang="c++">MyStruct a = {42, "Hello", "World", "Extra!"};
</code></pre>
<p>According to the standard, that's an error. Or... is it? Let's try out this example:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code lang="c++">struct A {
    int x;
};
struct B {
    A a;
    std::string y;
};
struct C {
    B b;
    const char *z;
};
C o = {42, "Hello", "World"};
</code></pre>
<p>Yes. Believe it or not, the object o will now contain three members: o.b.a.x, o.b.y and o.z. All three will be properly initialized with their respective value.</p>
<p>Aggregate initializations should, according to the standard, be smart enough to initialize aggregate objects and use any "spill over" to continue initializing other values/aggregate objects recursively.</p>
<h3>Bonus I:<a name="bonusi"></a></h3>
<p>Aggregate initialization is also what makes this idiom valid:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code lang="c++">char x[] = {1, 2, 3}
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, x will be of length 3 because that's the length of its aggregate initializer.</p>
<h3>Bonus II:<a name="bonusii"></a></h3>
<p>I'm sure anyone trying to get up to date with C++11 will have played around with variadic templates. One of the first exercises I'd recommend for this would be a compile-time list of different types. Knowing about aggregate initializations now, how would you write a constructor for this type?</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code lang="c++">template &lt;typename H, typename... T&gt;
struct Multilist&lt;H, T...&gt; {
    H x;
    Multilist&lt;T...&gt; next;
};
Multilist&lt;int, string, float&gt; foo{42, "XXX", 1.23};
</code></pre>
