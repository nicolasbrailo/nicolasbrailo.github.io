<p>Do you know the quickest way to create a constructor that initializes the elements in this struct?</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">#include <string>
struct MyStruct {
    int x;
    std::string y;
    const char *z;
};
</code></pre>
<p>If you answered "by typing really fast", you may be interested in knowing that the fastest way to create this constructor is to not write it at all!</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">MyStruct a = {42, "Hello", "World"};
</code></pre>
<p>Yes, the line above works and it's perfectly legal C++. It's event C++ 98! This language feature is called aggregate initialization and it says the compiler should be smart enough to initialize MyStruct using each value successively. Of course C++11 has made this syntax somewhat simpler and a lot more uniform:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">MyStruct a{42, "Hello", "World"};
</code></pre>
<p>There are some caveats when using this initialization, namely that the initialized type must be an aggregate. An aggregate, in standard lingo, is a type that has some restrictions. No virtuals, no privates, etc. You can say it's a POD and in most cases you'd be right.</p>
<p>Now, is this also legal?</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">MyStruct a = {42, "Hello"};
</code></pre>
<p>You'd be tempted to say that's a syntax error. It's not, now z will just be default-initialized. What about this, then?</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">MyStruct a = {42, "Hello", "World", "Extra!"};
</code></pre>
<p>According to the standard, that's an error. Or... is it? Let's try out this example:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">struct A {
    int x;
};
struct B {
    A a;
    std::string y;
};
struct C {
    B b;
    const char *z;
};
C o = {42, "Hello", "World"};
</code></pre>
<p>Yes. Believe it or not, the object o will now contain three members: o.b.a.x, o.b.y and o.z. All three will be properly initialized with their respective value.</p>
<p>Aggregate initializations should, according to the standard, be smart enough to initialize aggregate objects and use any "spill over" to continue initializing other values/aggregate objects recursively.</p>
<h3>Bonus I:<a name="bonusi"></a></h3>
<p>Aggregate initialization is also what makes this idiom valid:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">char x[] = {1, 2, 3}
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, x will be of length 3 because that's the length of its aggregate initializer.</p>
<h3>Bonus II:<a name="bonusii"></a></h3>
<p>I'm sure anyone trying to get up to date with C++11 will have played around with variadic templates. One of the first exercises I'd recommend for this would be a compile-time list of different types. Knowing about aggregate initializations now, how would you write a constructor for this type?</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">template &lt;typename H, typename... T&gt;
struct Multilist&lt;H, T...&gt; {
    H x;
    Multilist&lt;T...&gt; next;
};
Multilist&lt;int, string, float&gt; foo{42, "XXX", 1.23};
</code></pre>
