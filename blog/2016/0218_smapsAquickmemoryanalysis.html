<h1>smaps: A quick memory analysis<a name="smapsaquickmemoryanalysis"></a></h1>
<p>Many times you see your process&rsquo; memory consumption skyrocketing even though you&rsquo;re quite certain you have no memory leaks. This usually marks for the beginning of a very lengthy debugging process with valgrind or a similar tool, but even so some times you might get stuck trying to debug some third party library.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a quick tip in Linux that can help you track down a lib gone haywire:</p>
<pre lang="bash" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">cat /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/smaps
</pre>
<p>smaps will report every mapped section of memory for a certain process, how big the memory allocation is and which binary created the allocation.</p>
