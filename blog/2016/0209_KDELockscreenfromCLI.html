<h1>KDE: Lock screen from CLI<a name="kdelockscreenfromcli"></a></h1>
<p>For some reason, one of my (seriously outdated) Kubuntu installations has the nasty habit of not locking the screen when pressing Ctrl+Alt+L. Not always, though. It seems to do this only when I'm in a hurry and need to quickly lock my PC before walking away. This happens often enough to be annoying, but not so frequently as to bother me enough to look for a proper solution.</p>
<p>Instead of looking for a proper solution, trying to determine what's stealing the focus of the Ctrl+Alt+L key command, I just settled for an easier workaround: lock the screen from the command line. I use the terminal most of the time anyway, so why not just use it to lock the screen as well?</p>
<p>The magic incantation is easy, if a bit cryptic at first:</p>
<pre style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">qdbus org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver /ScreenSaver Lock
</pre>
<p>"qdbus" is a broadcasting service for KDE (Qt, actually). This command basically tells the screen saver service to lock the screen. Works every time, and with an alias in my <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Nico.rc/blob/master/bash_aliases#L22" title="bashrc">bashrc</a>, I don't need to remember that horribly long command. Now I only need to determine if my computer detecting when I'm in a hurry is a sign of sentience, and whether this is a threat to mankind. Will report soon.</p>
