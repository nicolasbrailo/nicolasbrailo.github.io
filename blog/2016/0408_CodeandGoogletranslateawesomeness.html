<h1>Code and Google translate: awesomeness<a name="codeandgoogletranslateawesomeness"></a></h1>
<p>Some time ago I found out one of my articles was translated to another language (yay for that, woo for not letting me know about it). To understand what my own article said, I had to use Google translate on the site. Guess what? c++ and Google translate can produce hilarious results:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;"># The include &quot;throw.h&quot; the extern &quot;the C&quot; {void seppuku () {throw statement the Exception () ; }}
</pre>
<p>Another one I liked:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">the struct the Exception {};
#ifdef __cplusplus
the extern &quot;the C&quot; {
#endif
void seppuku ();
# Ifdef __cplusplus
}
# endif
</pre>
<p>Now you know it. Next time you&rsquo;re looking at some incomprehensible c++ code, run it through Google translate. It may improve it.</p>
