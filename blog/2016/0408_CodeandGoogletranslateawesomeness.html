<h1>Code and Google translate: awesomeness<a name="codeandgoogletranslateawesomeness"></a></h1>
<p>Some time ago I found out one of my articles was translated to another language (yay for that, woo for not letting me know about it). To understand what my own article said, I had to use Google translate on the site. Guess what? c++ and Google translate can produce hilarious results:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">
# The include &quot;throw.h&quot; the extern &quot;the C&quot; {void seppuku () {throw statement the Exception () ; }}
</pre>
<p>Another one I liked:</p>
<p>```c++</p>
<p>the struct the Exception {};</p>
<h1>ifdef __cplusplus<a name="ifdef__cplusplus"></a></h1>
<p>the extern &ldquo;the C&rdquo; {</p>
<h1>endif<a name="endif"></a></h1>
<p>void seppuku ();
# Ifdef __cplusplus
}
# endif

```

Now you know it. Next time you're looking at some incomprehensible c++ code, run it through Google translate. It may improve it.
