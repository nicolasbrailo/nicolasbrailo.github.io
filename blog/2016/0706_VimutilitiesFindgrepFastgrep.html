<h1>Vim utilities: Findgrep &amp; Fastgrep<a name="vimutilitiesfindgrepfastgrep"></a></h1>
<p>I spent some time writing utility scripts for my Vim setup. I figured I can share them here, someone may even find them useful or at least get a laugh out of it. Last time I presented "Impl switcher", and "Better Tab New" before that. Today it's Findgrep &amp; Fastgrep's turn.</p>
<p>I <a href="/blog/2012/1030_Fastgrepacacheforgrep.html">wrote about Fastgrep a long time ago</a>. The idea behind it is to speed up the slowest part in a grep command, the disk seek time, by creating a huge blob file with all the files in a project concatenated.</p>
<p>Fastgrep works great. But it requires a context switch, going from your IDE to your console just to grep. Findgrep fills the gap between the IDE and the command line: this utility provides a few key bindings to let you quickly run some common commands, like searching for a selected string or finding a file in the project directory.</p>
<p>You can get <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Nico.rc/blob/master/fastgrep.sh">Fastgrep here</a>. <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Nico.rc/blob/master/vim/plugins/findgrep.vim">Findgrep is available in Github</a>, and you can easily replace Fastgrep with normal grep if you need to.</p>
