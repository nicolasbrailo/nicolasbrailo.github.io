<h2>Vim utilities: Findgrep &amp; Fastgrep<a name="vimutilitiesfindgrepfastgrep"></a></h2>
<p>Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2016-07-06 | <a href="/blog/2016/0706_VimutilitiesFindgrepFastgrep.html">Permalink</a>  | <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/nicolasbrailo.github.io/issues/new?title=Comment@/blog/2016/0706_VimutilitiesFindgrepFastgrep.html&amp;body=I%20have%20a%20comment!">Leave a comment</a></p>
<p>I spent some time writing utility scripts for my Vim setup. I figured I can share them here, someone may even find them useful or at least get a laugh out of it. Last time I presented "Impl switcher", and "Better Tab New" before that. Today it's Findgrep &amp; Fastgrep's turn.</p>
<p>I <a href="/blog/2012/1030_Fastgrepacacheforgrep.html">wrote about Fastgrep a long time ago</a>. The idea behind it is to speed up the slowest part in a grep command, the disk seek time, by creating a huge blob file with all the files in a project concatenated.</p>
<p>Fastgrep works great. But it requires a context switch, going from your IDE to your console just to grep. Findgrep fills the gap between the IDE and the command line: this utility provides a few key bindings to let you quickly run some common commands, like searching for a selected string or finding a file in the project directory.</p>
<p>You can get <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Nico.rc/blob/master/fastgrep.sh">Fastgrep here</a>. <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Nico.rc/blob/master/vim/plugins/findgrep.vim">Findgrep is available in Github</a>, and you can easily replace Fastgrep with normal grep if you need to.</p>

<h2>Vim utilities: Impl switcher<a name="vimutilitiesimplswitcher"></a></h2>

<p>I spent some time writing utility scripts for my Vim setup. I figured I can share them here, someone may even find them useful or at least get a laugh out of it. Last time I presented "<a href="/blog/2016/0701_VimutilitiesBetterTabNew.html">BTN: Better Tab New</a>". Today it's the turn for "Impl switcher".</p>
<p>With its very imaginative name, "Impl switcher" has a very obvious purpose: it will just switch from a header file to an implementation file. So, between .h and .cpp. Surely there are lots of Vim plugins to do just that, why write another one?</p>
<p>Most impl-switcher plugins in the wild tend to, in my experience, require either a lot of configuration, a lot of dependencies, or a very specific project layout (or a combination of all three). They also seem to be huge and very complicated projects.</p>
<p>Impl switcher will recursively go up your directory hierarchy and use "find" to locate any files named like your base file but with a different extension. That makes it very simple and it requires minimal (if any) configuration: just drop it in your .vimrc file and you're good to go. OK, not exactly: it requires a Linux-like system with utilities like "find". Still, a good trade-off to keep the project's dependencies as small as possible.</p>

<h2>Vim utilities: Better Tab New<a name="vimutilitiesbettertabnew"></a></h2>
<p>Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2016-07-01 | <a href="/blog/2016/0701_VimutilitiesBetterTabNew.html">Permalink</a>  | <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/nicolasbrailo.github.io/issues/new?title=Comment@/blog/2016/0701_VimutilitiesBetterTabNew.html&amp;body=I%20have%20a%20comment!">Leave a comment</a></p>
<p>I spent some time writing utility scripts for my Vim setup. I figured I can share them here, someone may even find them useful or at least get a laugh out of it. The first one is called "Better Tab New" and you can get it from my <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Nico.rc/blob/master/vim/plugins/bettertabnew.vim">Github repo</a> or from the script's <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=5405">Vim page</a>.</p>
<p>Why would you want a better tab new, and what's wrong with the default one? Simple: tabnew, in Vim, will just open a file. For that to happen you need to specify the exact path of a file. That's usually perfectly fine, but sometimes you need tabnew to be a bit smarter: maybe you just grep'ed something and ended up with a path that looks like "/foo/bar/baz:my_text:42". Or maybe you want to open a file and go to a specific line. Those are things for which the default tabnew implementation isn't very good. BTN fills that niche and lets you create a simpler workflow when using grep.</p>
