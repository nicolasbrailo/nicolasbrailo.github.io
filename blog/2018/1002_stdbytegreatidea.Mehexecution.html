<h1>std::byte - great idea. Meh execution?<a name="stdbytegreatidea.mehexecution"></a></h1>
<p>I love the idea of C++17's <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/byte">std::byte</a>. A data-type that makes it explicit we're dealing with ugly low-level details? What's there not to love! One thing only, turns out.</p>
<p>First, the good part: separating character (human) representation from binary (low-level) representation is brilliant. No implicit conversion between the two separates the domains very well and creates a much clearer interface.</p>
<p>The bad part: std::byte is really really strict. It only accepts other std::bytes as operands(*). You'd hope this would work</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">auto f() {
  byte b{42};
  return b &amp;amp; 0b11;
}
</pre>
<p>It doesn't. std::byte only accepts other std::byte's as operands. The design goal behind it is good, sure. In practice, I've noticed this means casts are not limited to the interface between low-level and rest-of-the-world: casts and explicit byte's get sprinkled all over the place.</p>
<p>My prediction: most people will dislike the boilerplate std::byte adds and fall back to unsinged char's, until the type restrictions in std::byte are relaxed. I hope I'm wrong though!</p>
<p>(*) Yes, with the exception of shift operations. That was a good design decision!</p>
