<h1>Happiest bug report<a name="happiestbugreport"></a></h1>
<p>Something is wrong: I'm happy over a bug report!</p>
<p>A few years back I developed a <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/VlcFreemote">VlcRemote control</a> app for Android. According <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">to this chart</a>, I didn't actually save any time doing so. The time I spent spent developing the app is more than the cumulative time I would have spent by getting up from the couch and manually controlling VLC. That said, not having to leave the coziness of a warm blanket in winter probably made it worth the investment.</p>
<p>Not long ago I decided to <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nicolasbrailo.vlcfreemote/">submit this app to F-Droid</a>. I'm too cheap to pay the 20ish dollars for Google App Store, and since I don't have any commercial interest I don't see the point. I didn't think I'd actually get any users there, but today I got my first bug report. So much happiness! You'd think I shouldn't be happy about my crappy software not-working, but hey, someone actually took the time to try it out. Even more, someone cared enough to submit a bug report!</p>
<p>Open source rules!</p>
