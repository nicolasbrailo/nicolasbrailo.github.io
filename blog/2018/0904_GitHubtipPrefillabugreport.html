<h1>GitHub tip: Prefill a bug report<a name="githubtipprefillabugreport"></a></h1>
<p>Getting feedback from users is hard. In a platform such as Android, with apps evaluated in a couple of seconds, it's even harder.</p>
<p>While trying to get bug reports for <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/VlcFreemote">VlcFreemote</a> I found a neat GitHub trick: you can pre-fill a bug report by using url parameters. For example, check this link: <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/VlcFreemote/issues/new?title=foo&amp;body=bar">https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/VlcFreemote/issues/new?title=foo&amp;body=bar</a></p>
<p>Awesome! Takes a second and makes life much easier for bug-reporters!</p>
