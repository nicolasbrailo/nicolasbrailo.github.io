<h1>-Wmisleading-indentation<a name="wmisleadingindentation"></a></h1>
<p>By Nico Brailovsky @ 2018-09-30</p>
<p>This gcc switch is a few years old but I discovered it recently. I&rsquo;m not sure if that means my code is always very clean or my toolchain too oudated&hellip; in any case, -Wmisleading-indentation (which you get with -Wall) warns about this gotcha:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">if (foo)
   bar();
   baz();
</pre>
<p>Neat!</p>

<h1>GitHub tip: Prefill a bug report<a name="githubtipprefillabugreport"></a></h1>
<p>By Nico Brailovsky @ 2018-09-04</p>
<p>Getting feedback from users is hard. In a platform such as Android, with apps evaluated in a couple of seconds, it&rsquo;s even harder.</p>
<p>While trying to get bug reports for <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/VlcFreemote">VlcFreemote</a> I found a neat GitHub trick: you can pre-fill a bug report by using url parameters. For example, check this link: <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/VlcFreemote/issues/new?title=foo&amp;body=bar">https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/VlcFreemote/issues/new?title=foo&amp;body=bar</a></p>
<p>Awesome! Takes a second and makes life much easier for bug-reporters!</p>

<p>Something is wrong: I&rsquo;m happy over a bug report!</p>
<p>A few years back I developed a <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/VlcFreemote">VlcRemote control</a> app for Android. According <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">to this chart</a>, I didn&rsquo;t actually save any time doing so. The time I spent spent developing the app is more than the cumulative time I would have spent by getting up from the couch and manually controlling VLC. That said, not having to leave the coziness of a warm blanket in winter probably made it worth the investment.</p>
<p>Not long ago I decided to <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nicolasbrailo.vlcfreemote/">submit this app to F-Droid</a>. I&rsquo;m too cheap to pay the 20ish dollars for Google App Store, and since I don&rsquo;t have any commercial interest I don&rsquo;t see the point. I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d actually get any users there, but today I got my first bug report. So much happiness! You&rsquo;d think I shouldn&rsquo;t be happy about my crappy software not-working, but hey, someone actually took the time to try it out. Even more, someone cared enough to submit a bug report!</p>
<p>Open source rules!</p>
