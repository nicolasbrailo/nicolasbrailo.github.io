<h1>Gdb hit count: ignoring breakpoints (for a while)<a name="gdbhitcountignoringbreakpointsforawhile"></a></h1>
<p>Some times a breakpoint is not enough; if you have a crash inside a loop, the object that makes your code crash might be in the 526th iteration. How can you debug this problem?</p>
<p>One way would be to set up a <a href="/blog/2013/0625_Watchpointsingdbwakemeupwhenfoochanges.html">watch expression</a>. If you can't setup a watch expression, say, because you're using an iterator and it'd be hard to set one, you can also tell gdb to setup a breakpoint, and then ignore it N times.</p>
<p>Let's see how this works with this example:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code lang="c++">
#include <vector>
int main() {
    std::vector<int> v = {1,2,3,4,5,0,7,8,9};
    int x = 42;
    for (auto i = v.begin(); i != v.end(); ++i) {
        x = x / *i;
    }
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>After compiling we run it to see it crash; let's start it on gdb, then set a brakepoint on the line where it crashes.</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code lang="c++">
(gdb) break foo.cpp:8
Breakpoint 1 at 0x4007bc: file foo.cpp, line 8.
(gdb) info breakpoints
Num     Type           Disp Enb Address            What
1       breakpoint     keep y   0x00000000004007bc in main() at foo.cpp:8
</code></pre>
<p>Typing "info breakpoints" will tell you the breakpoint number; then we can tell gdb to ignore this breakpoint forever (where forever is a very large number, so the program will run until it crashes):</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code lang="c++">(gdb) ignore 1 99999
Will ignore next 99999 crossings of breakpoint 1.
(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/nico/src/a.out
Program received signal SIGFPE, Arithmetic exception.
0x00000000004007d5 in main () at foo.cpp:8
8            x = x / *i;
(gdb) info breakpoints
Num     Type           Disp Enb Address            What
1       breakpoint     keep y   0x00000000004007bc in main() at foo.cpp:8
    breakpoint already hit 6 times
    ignore next 99993 hits
(gdb)
</code></pre>
<p>By doing this now we know the program crashes the sixth time it goes through that breakpoint. Now we can actually debug the problem:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code lang="c++">(gdb) ignore 1 5
Will ignore next 5 crossings of breakpoint 1.
(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/nico/src/a.out
Breakpoint 1, main () at foo.cpp:8
8            x = x / <em>i;
(gdb) p </em>i
$1 = (int &amp;) @0x603024: 0
</code></pre>
<p>This time gdb will break exactly on the spot we want.</p>

<p>Why not use a print i command when you get the exception? Will it not tell you the iteration? I like your hack, but I want to know if this solution is the only way for your example.</p>

<p>Hi Antiskeptic, for the first part of the article, you can indeed simply <code>print i</code> to know which iteration is triggering the bug. That should work just as fine as ignoring it forever and then checking the count in gdb, or writing <code>cout &lt;&lt; i</code> in the loop.</p>
<p>For the second part of the article, you still need to use the ignore command. If you want to debug the problem by setting a breakpoint, and only have it trigger in the Nth iteration of the loop, I can't really think of any other ways than setting a (possible complicated) watch expression or using the ignore command. There may be and I'm just not being imaginative enough. C++ is an amazing stack that way, people can come up with very creative solutions to all kinds of problems.</p>
