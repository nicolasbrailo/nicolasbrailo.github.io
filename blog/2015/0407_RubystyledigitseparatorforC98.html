<h1>Ruby-style digit separator for C-98?<a name="rubystyledigitseparatorforc98"></a></h1>
<p>A silly, and not very useful tip: I love how ruby allows you to write numbers like 1000000 as 1_000_000. Very useful to write benchmarking tests.</p>
<p>Until we get to C++14 we don't have a nice alternative, but we have an ugly hack we can use: instead of writing 1000000 write "1 ## 000 ## 000".</p>
<p>It works, '##' is the preprocessor's token pasting operator, and it will paste two tokens together. Looks ugly, breaks the GUI highlighting, but at least you can count how many zeros you've got.</p>
<p>Nitpicker's corner: multiplying by 10 is easier, but there is no job-safety involved in that.</p>
<p>Nitpicker's corner II: The evaluation order of a chain of '##' is not defined, but I don't expect this to cause any problems; any order of evaluation should result in the same result for this case.</p>
