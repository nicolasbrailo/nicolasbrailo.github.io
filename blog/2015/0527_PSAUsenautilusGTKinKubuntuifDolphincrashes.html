<h1>PSA: Use nautilus (GTK) in Kubuntu if Dolphin crashes<a name="psausenautilusgtkinkubuntuifdolphincrashes"></a></h1>
<p>So, for some reason my (brand new) Kubuntu is not very stable. KDE tends to randomly crash whenever I send a large-ish file to the recycling bin. Dunno why, looks like some threading + caching issue in dolphin, and I couldn't find a solution anywhere on the web. Well, there are two workarounds:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't use the recycling bin. This sort of breaks my workflow, so I prefer to:</li>
<li>Use nautilus.</li>
</ol>
<p>You'll have to install gtk packages, but that's a small price to pay to have KDE not crash every couple of minutes.</p>
