<h1>Vim Tip: I want more menus!<a name="vimtipiwantmoremenus"></a></h1>
<p>As a uber vim geek, you shouldn't be using a lot of gui menus. Scratch that, you shouldn't be using any menus at all, period. Still, I'll admit it's a bit hard to remember every single shortcut for actions you rarely use.</p>
<p>Say, for example, you like to encrypt your text. Not always, but every once in a while. Enough to make a shortcut for it but not enough to remember what the shortcut is. You can try to grep your ~/.vimrc. You might find something like:</p>
<pre style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">&quot; Encrypt my stuff
map &lt;leader&gt;e ggg?G&lt;CR&gt;
</pre>
<p>(Yes, that command will actually encrypt your text in Vim. Try it!)</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice if you had a simpler way, though?</p>
<p>Turns out you can add your "encrypt" command to your gui. Then "menu" commands work just like the "map" family, but they create a GUI menu instead. Change your vimrc to something like this:</p>
<pre style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">&quot; Encrypt my stuff
map &lt;leader&gt;e ggg?G&lt;CR&gt;
menu Project.Encrypt ggg?G&lt;CR&gt;
</pre>
<p>Now if you reload your vimrc you'll find a new GUI menu created, from which you can easily encrypt your text. Decrypting is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>
<p>Extra tip: Want to try to learn the actual shortcut, like a real vim'er? Then try this:</p>
<pre style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">menu Project.Encrypt&lt;TAB&gt;ggg?G ggg?G&lt;CR&gt;
</pre>
<p>Everything after the TAB will be right-aligned: you can use that space to annotate the key-combo you should use next time.</p>
