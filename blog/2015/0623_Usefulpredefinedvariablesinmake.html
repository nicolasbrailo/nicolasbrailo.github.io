<h1>Useful predefined variables in make<a name="usefulpredefinedvariablesinmake"></a></h1>
<p>I always forget about two very useful make variables, so I'll leave this here: $(COMPILE.cpp), $(LINK.cpp).
It's easy, instead of writing a rule as</p>
<pre style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">foo.o: foo.cpp
  g++ -c foo.coo
</pre>
<p>you should instead write this:</p>
<pre style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">foo.o: foo.cpp
  $(COMPILE.cpp) foo.coo
</pre>
<p>COMPILE.cpp will have the default compiler you are supposed to use, and probably some helpful parameters as well. Likewise, LINK.cpp will have the linker you are supposed to use.</p>
<p>There are many useful predefined variables in make. Be sure to check them all by running "make -p" in a console.</p>
