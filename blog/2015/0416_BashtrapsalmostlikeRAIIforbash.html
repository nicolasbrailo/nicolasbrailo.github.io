<h1>Bash traps: almost like RAII for bash<a name="bashtrapsalmostlikeraiiforbash"></a></h1>
<p>Everywhere, but specially in bash, cleaning up is annoying and error prone. Resource leaks can be common if your bash script is interrupted half-way. Do you need to execute something always, even if your script fails or gets killed? Try using traps:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">#!/bin/bash
foobar() {&lt;br/&gt;    echo &quot;See ya!&quot;&lt;br/&gt;}
trap &quot;foobar&quot; EXIT
</pre>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t mater how you end this script, &ldquo;foobar&rdquo; will always be executed. Want to read more about bash traps? Check <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/wss0160.php">http://linuxcommand.org/wss0160.php</a></p>
