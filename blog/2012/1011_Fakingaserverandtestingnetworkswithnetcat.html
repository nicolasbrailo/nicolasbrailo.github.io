<h1>Faking a server and testing networks with netcat<a name="fakingaserverandtestingnetworkswithnetcat"></a></h1>
<p>Not long ago I wrote about having to use iptables to redirect packets from one port to another. Testing this with a real server may be complicated, or at least inconvenient. Luckily we have netcat to help us.</p>
<p>If you use &ldquo;nc -l 1234&rdquo;, netcat will create a listening socket on the port 1234. You can check if it&rsquo;s working by doing a &ldquo;telnet IP 1234&rdquo;, nc should echo whatever you type on the client in the server. In the example from my article explaining an iptables rule, you would do an nc -l 1234, apply the iptables rule and the issue a &ldquo;netcat IP 4321&rdquo;. If everything went according to plan you should be seeing the echo on your nc server.</p>
