<h1>stlfilt: read ugly tmpl errors<a name="stlfiltreaduglytmplerrors"></a></h1>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing better for Monday mornings than the smell of hundreds of template errors after a make clean all. When using template metaprogramming, a tiny misplaced coma can generate enough error code that, if printed, would crush you under tones of paper. And don&rsquo;t even try to read them, it&rsquo;ll make your head explode.</p>
<p>Luckily <a href="http://www.bdsoft.com/tools/stlfilt.html">STLFilt</a> can be quite a relief when dealing with this kind of errors. Granted, it won&rsquo;t make a steaming pile of poo seem to be a nice poem, but if you have something like the dog in the picture, to use a metaphor, at least it would put a blanket on its face.</p>
