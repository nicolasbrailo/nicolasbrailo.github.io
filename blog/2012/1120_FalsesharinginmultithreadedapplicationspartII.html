<h1>False sharing in multi threaded applications, part II<a name="falsesharinginmultithreadedapplicationspartii"></a></h1>
<p>In the last entry we learned how an apparently parallel algorithm can turn into a sequential nightmare via false sharing; what you may think to be two independent variables may actually be spatially close, thus sharing a cache line which gets invalidated by each and every write across cores. But is this a real world issue? If so, how can we fix it?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll work backwards: let&rsquo;s see first how can this be fixed, and then we&rsquo;ll check if this is actually a real world issue.</p>
<p>Remember our code sample, from last time:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">void lots_of_sums(unsigned idx, int v[])
{
    const unsigned itrs = 2000<em>1000</em>1000;
    for (int i=0; i &amp;lt; itrs; ++i)
        v[idx].num = i;
}
</pre>
<p>An easy way to avoid false sharing would be to just assign i to a temporary variable, then assign the real result to v[i]; this way, you would be writing only once, the intermediate results will be in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-local_storage">TSS</a>, thus avoiding the contention in the loop.</p>
<p>The second strategy to solve this problem would be to use padding. Knowing that your cache line is made of 64 bytes will let you write something like this:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">struct Padded {
    int num;
    char pad[60];
};
</pre>
<p>Of course, this has another problem: what about the offset? We need not only padding but also spacing, for the alignment.</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">struct Padded {
    char space[60];
    int num;
    char pad[60];
};
</pre>
<p>Alternatively, you could use the align keyword of C++0x, but since it&rsquo;s not implemented on g++ I have never tested it before, so I have no idea how it&rsquo;s supposed to work.
