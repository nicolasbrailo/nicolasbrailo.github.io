<h1>g++ has a (mean) personaility<a name="ghasameanpersonaility"></a></h1>
<p>Did you ever get a message like "undefined reference to `__gxx_personality_v0'"? It means you are trying to link c++ code with a c linker, just change gcc with g++. But what is gxx_personality?</p>
<p>Basically, gxx_personality is a global pointer used for stack unwinding. You could make your code compile (assuming you don't have other problems with vtables and such) by defining it as a NULL ptr, and everything should work until an exception is thrown.</p>
