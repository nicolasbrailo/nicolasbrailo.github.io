<h1>CLI music FTW!<a name="climusicftw"></a></h1>
<p>Does your music collection suck? Did you have to delete all your mp3 because you were facing a major lawsuit by the MPAA? Make your own console-music! Just open a terminal and type this for hours of endless fun:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">cat /dev/urandom | aplay
</pre>
<p>Aditional tip: if you ever get tired of the random static, you can have fun playing your boot images like this:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">cat /boot/initrd.img-3.0.0-12-generic | aplay
</pre>
<p>I wonder if that has copyrights....</p>
