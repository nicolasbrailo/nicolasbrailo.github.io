<h1>Printing broken in Ubuntu? Try lpr<a name="printingbrokeninubuntutrylpr"></a></h1>
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve seen quite a few Ubuntu machines with broken printing (more broken than usual, that is). Sometimes printers are detected, sometimes not. When it doesn&rsquo;t work you usually get a warning saying &ldquo;Getting printer information failed&rdquo; even though the printer is connected and you can even ping it. Searching around a little bit I read a couple of threads and bug reports that make me think that it&rsquo;s actually a Gnome 3 migration problem, but I&rsquo;m not sure. It doesn&rsquo;t matter much anyway: screw UIs, just use <strong>lpr &lt; foo.pdf</strong> from a CLI and keep on killing forests!</p>
<p>On a cheerful closing note: how funny is it that when the regular printing applet in Gnome is broken we have to use a utility by &ldquo;Apple Inc&rdquo;?</p>
