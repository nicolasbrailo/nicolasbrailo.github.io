<h1>Printing broken in Ubuntu? Try lpr<a name="printingbrokeninubuntutrylpr"></a></h1>
<p>Lately I've seen quite a few Ubuntu machines with broken printing (more broken than usual, that is). Sometimes printers are detected, sometimes not. When it doesn't work you usually get a warning saying "Getting printer information failed" even though the printer is connected and you can even ping it. Searching around a little bit I read a couple of threads and bug reports that make me think that it's actually a Gnome 3 migration problem, but I'm not sure. It doesn't matter much anyway: screw UIs, just use <strong>lpr &lt; foo.pdf</strong> from a CLI and keep on killing forests!</p>
<p>On a cheerful closing note: how funny is it that when the regular printing applet in Gnome is broken we have to use a utility by "Apple Inc"?</p>
