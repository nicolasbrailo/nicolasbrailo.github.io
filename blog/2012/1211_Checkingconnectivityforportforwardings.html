<h1>Checking connectivity for port forwardings<a name="checkingconnectivityforportforwardings"></a></h1>
<p>This is a little bit outside of what I normally post, but when I find such a terribly useful site I need to share it (so I won&rsquo;t forget next time I need it).</p>
<p>Have you ever had to set up a forwarding to expose a LAN service to the outside world? It kind of sucks not knowing if you set up everything correctly, and it&rsquo;s not easy to test, since you can only test if the service is working inside your LAN. Normally you would need to either bounce on a proxy outside, or ask a friend to nmap you. Alternatively, you can use <a href="http://canyouseeme.org/">canyouseeme.org</a>, a website that will probe a specific port on the IP you specify, and tell you if it times out or if it&rsquo;s open.</p>
<p>A great time saver.</p>
