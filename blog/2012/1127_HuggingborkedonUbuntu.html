<h1>Hugging borked on Ubuntu?<a name="huggingborkedonubuntu"></a></h1>
<p>Hugging is pretty awesome to create panoramic photos. I use it regularly, for example for this awesome Prague old town square panoramic I took some time ago:</p>

<p>At some point I realized that, after an upgrade, Hugging just stopped finding connection points. Apparently there's a licences issue somewhere. Just "sudo apt-get install autopano-sift" and continue hugging.</p>
