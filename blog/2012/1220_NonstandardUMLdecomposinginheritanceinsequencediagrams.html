<h1>Non standard UML: decomposing inheritance in sequence diagrams<a name="nonstandardumldecomposinginheritanceinsequencediagrams"></a></h1>
<p>TL;DR: In sequence diagrams, separating an object into (some of) its parent classes improves readibility, at the cost of a not so accurate structure description.</p>
<p>A sequence diagram is supposed to display interactions between objects, making enphasis on its sequentiality. The important part here is "between objects"; as far as I know, the standard states that you should display interaction between entities, or the interaction of an entity with itself through a public interface.</p>
<p>Usually this works just fine, since a sequence diagram provides a way of understanding a program through the interaction of its entities, however I found that sometimes you need to express the interaction of an object with his own public interface with a little bit more of detail, namely when there's inheritance involved.</p>
<p>When there's an extension relationship between two objects, and a dependency (i.e. a call) in methods of this two classes, the code for each method usually "lives" far appart, most usually in two different files. Portraying these two methods as a reflexive call is sintactically accurate for a sequence diagram, but I found it very poor semantically. Representing this dependency as a call between two different objects might not be a sintactically correct representation, as you are treating a single entity as two different objects, but I have found it results in much clearer and cleaner diagrams.</p>
<p>Of course spliting an entity into multiple objects has the disadvantage of inducing the reader to believe these are indeed different objects, but since the purpose of a sequence diagram is not to display a static structure I believe this is an acceptable tradeoff, one that can be diminished by just using a note and a reference to a class diagram, where the accurate structure of the classes can be displayed.</p>
