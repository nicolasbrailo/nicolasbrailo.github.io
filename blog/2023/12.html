<h1>Fix Spotify deeplinking in Linux + custom SpotiWeb UI<a name="fixspotifydeeplinkinginlinuxcustomspotiwebui"></a></h1>
<p>By Nico Brailovsky @ 2023-12-16 -  <a href="/blog/2023/1216_FixSpotifydeeplinkinginLinuxcustomSpotiWebUI.html">Permalink</a></p>
<p>After a recent update I found <a href="https://nicolasbrailo.github.io/SpotiWeb/">my custom Spotify UI (*)</a> wasn't working. The way my custom UI works is by generating a simple list of followed artists, and then playing in the native app by using deep-linking. A recent update seems to have broken this in Linux based OSes, so here's my fix:</p>
<pre lang="bash" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">sudo mv /usr/share/spotify/spotify /usr/share/spotify/spotify.real
sudo echo &#x27;/usr/share/spotify/spotify.real --uri=&quot;$1&quot;&#x27; &gt; /usr/share/spotify/spotify
</pre>
<p>Seems old versions of spotify would try to open anything as a deeplink, but new versions require a <code>--uri</code> parameter on argv. Surely there is a cleaner way of doing this in xdg-open, but I'm too lazy to read manuals.</p>
<p>In the "reminder to myself" category, as there is zero chance I'll remember this next time I'm setting up a computer.</p>
<h3>(*) SpotiWeb: custom Spotify UI<a name="spotiwebcustomspotifyui"></a></h3>
<p>I don't like "recent" changes (recent being the last 3 or 4 years!) to Spotify's UI, <a href="https://nicolasbrailo.github.io/SpotiWeb/">so I rolled out my own</a>. It's a plain, boring, unobtrusive view of all your followed artists, grouped by categories. It also runs in any browser and is extremely minimalist (doesn't even have a search function: you can use the browser's search if you need one!)</p>
<p>The app is hosted in github pages, and because it's entirely client side it doesn't need any kind of server side support to run. Check out the source here and <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/SpotiWeb">either run your own, or check out there's no server side processing involved.</a></p>
