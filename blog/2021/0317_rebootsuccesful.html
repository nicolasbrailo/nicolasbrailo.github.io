<p>&ldquo;Since &ldquo;migrating&rdquo; from Wordpress to Blogspot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traffic to Wordpress fell from ~100ish visitors a day to ~30 or ~40ish.</li>
<li>This site went from 0 to also ~30 or ~40ish.</li>
</ul>
<p>That went much better than I expected, considering I couldn&rsquo;t set up a proper HTTP301-permanently moved (WP charges you for that, which IMO is slight extortionate for a site I don&rsquo;t want to monetize). Let&rsquo;s see how it goes 10 years from now, when I have to migrate from Blogpost to something else.</p>
