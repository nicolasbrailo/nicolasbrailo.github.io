<h1>About me<a name="aboutme"></a></h1>
<p>I am an information systems engineer who like to works on complex
problems, but still hasn’t managed to solve the complex problem of
having only 24 hours a day. Besides programming, I also like writing on
my blogs and giving classes or lectures on the subjects I like the most.
 I usually post these presentations in the blog, so keep track of the
changes here if you’re interested.</p>
