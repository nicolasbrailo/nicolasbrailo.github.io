<h1>Where is the fun in that?<a name="whereisthefuninthat"></a></h1>

<p>You can always find coders asking why coding isn&rsquo;t fun anymore. I can somewhat relate but I never understood why the answer isn&rsquo;t obvious: coding isn&rsquo;t software engineering. When you go from coding to engineering, the focus changes. A lot of the interesting stuff is there, but there&rsquo;s also not-interesting-stuff in the mix. Maybe testing and documenting isn&rsquo;t your thing, you just want to build something. Maybe the stability from testing and documenting isn&rsquo;t that important to you. Perhaps you know you&rsquo;re the only one who&rsquo;s ever going to read your code. Your future self may be angry at you for a little while if the code breaks&hellip; so what? Your experiment crashed? Just reboot it. No problem.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re coding-to-sell, you&rsquo;re not writing code for yourself. You write for a team, even if that team is only you and future-you. You write it so it may scale and adapt to new requirements. You write it to survive a bit more than a weekend, and to be stable. You&rsquo;re not writing code to learn new things, that&rsquo;s only a nice side-effect; you are trying to build a product.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you&rsquo;re not investing time to learn something or just to have fun; you&rsquo;re trading time for money (if you learn something in the process, that&rsquo;s good - but probably not why you&rsquo;re being paid a salary as a software engineer).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s understandable that parts of software engineering are not as fun as it was hacking in a basement while you were a kid. There is still a very big overlap, but it&rsquo;s not just the same activity. Myself, I try to focus on the fun parts and just have discipline to get the boring parts out of the way. I usually work in places where the balance is fairly decent, and it&rsquo;s kept me interested in software development for the last 15 (ish) years. I&rsquo;m hoping it&rsquo;ll do the trick for much longer than that.</p>

<p>Since &ldquo;migrating&rdquo; from Wordpress to Blogspot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traffic to Wordpress fell from ~100ish visitors a day to ~30 or ~40ish.</li>
<li>This site went from 0 to also ~30 or ~40ish.</li>
</ul>
<p>That went much better than I expected, considering I couldn&rsquo;t set up a proper HTTP301-permanently moved (WP charges you for that, which IMO is slight extortionate for a site I don&rsquo;t want to monetize). Let&rsquo;s see how it goes 10 years from now, when I have to migrate from Blogpost to something else.</p>

<p>Recently found out Wordpress had pretty aggressive ads on my blog. That worked as the encouragement I was needing to work on a task I&rsquo;d been putting off for years: fix bit-rotted content! I took the opportunity to fix all (most) broken links and source code snippets from the last 14 years. It was supposed to be a short sed script, which of course ended up being 3 days of work - a lot of it manual. A few cool things I figured doing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if I very sparingly add new posts, 14 years is still a lot of content. By the infinite monkey theorem, some of it should be good. Right?</li>
<li>A new reason to dislike template metaprogramming: so many &lsquo;template &amp; lt; class &amp; gt;&rsquo;, so much broken code&hellip;</li>
<li>I have 400+ posts and less than 10 images. While I quite like adding visual content, very little of it (except memes!) survived the successive blog migrations.</li>
<li>I can estimate there have been at least 3 platform migrations since the first post. I can count the number of times that &lsquo;&lt;&rsquo; gets html-encoded like the rings of a tree. &lsquo;&amp; amp;amp;lt;&rsquo; was the longest encode sequence I found.</li>
</ul>
