<h1>Where is the fun in that?<a name="whereisthefuninthat"></a></h1>
<p>You can always find coders asking why coding isn&rsquo;t fun anymore. I can somewhat relate but I never understood why the answer isn&rsquo;t obvious: coding isn&rsquo;t software engineering. When you go from coding to engineering, the focus changes. A lot of the interesting stuff is there, but there&rsquo;s also not-interesting-stuff in the mix. Maybe testing and documenting isn&rsquo;t your thing, you just want to build something. Maybe the stability from testing and documenting isn&rsquo;t that important to you. Perhaps you know you&rsquo;re the only one who&rsquo;s ever going to read your code. Your future self may be angry at you for a little while if the code breaks&hellip; so what? Your experiment crashed? Just reboot it. No problem.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re coding-to-sell, you&rsquo;re not writing code for yourself. You write for a team, even if that team is only you and future-you. You write it so it may scale and adapt to new requirements. You write it to survive a bit more than a weekend, and to be stable. You&rsquo;re not writing code to learn new things, that&rsquo;s only a nice side-effect; you are trying to build a product.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you&rsquo;re not investing time to learn something or just to have fun; you&rsquo;re trading time for money (if you learn something in the process, that&rsquo;s good - but probably not why you&rsquo;re being paid a salary as a software engineer).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s understandable that parts of software engineering are not as fun as it was hacking in a basement while you were a kid. There is still a very big overlap, but it&rsquo;s not just the same activity. Myself, I try to focus on the fun parts and just have discipline to get the boring parts out of the way. I usually work in places where the balance is fairly decent, and it&rsquo;s kept me interested in software development for the last 15 (ish) years. I&rsquo;m hoping it&rsquo;ll do the trick for much longer than that.</p>
