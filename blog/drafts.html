<h2>Fix "slow" Grub</h2>

<p>Grub tends to be setup-and-forget, so this is a tip that should be useless. Except when things break.</p>
<p>I noticed while fixing a computer that Grub was "slow" - each keystroke would take about half a second to show up on the screen, give or take a hundred ms, and it wouldn't even queue my keystrokes (leading to skipped keys, and even more frustrating sessions of backspace-backspace-backspace, fix-fix-fix, repeat). This seems to be related to Grub running in a very high resolution, which should be entirely unnecessary - I don't care about 4K boot menus, nor about 4K boot splash screens that will be displayed for a second or two.</p>
<p>To fix slow-Grub, it's enough to tell it to stick to a more terminal-friendly resolution. Debian-based example:</p>
<p>Add this to /etc/default/grub</p>
<pre lang="bash"><code class="language-bash" lang="bash">GRUB_GFXMODE=1024x768
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="nosplash verbose debug nomodeset"
</code></pre>
<p>Then run <code>update-grub</code>. Next boot up Grub input should behave in a sane way again.</p>

<h2>Wifi from CLI + Working on main eth connection<a name="wififromcliworkingonmainethconnection"></a></h2>
<p>Work on the main eth connection while connected to Wireless</p>
<p>Find out the state of network</p>
<pre lang="bash"><code class="language-bash" lang="bash">## Figure out which interfaces exist
ip a
## Figure out which interfaces are connected
ip link show
ip link show wlp3s0
</code></pre>
<p>Restart the interface, which will do nothing</p>
<pre><code>ip link set wlp3s0 down
ip link set wlp3s0 up
</code></pre>
<p>Start <code>wpa_cli</code>. Creating a new network may be needed, but I don't have notes. Once a network is created, its config will be in <code>/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</code>. Then:</p>
<pre lang="bash"><code class="language-bash" lang="bash">$ wpa_cli
&gt; scan
[Wait a few seconds]
&gt; scan_results
&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Connect?</p>
<pre lang="bash"><code class="language-bash" lang="bash"># Connect
wpa_supplicant -B -i wlp3s -c &lt; $( wpa_passphrase "&lt;your ssid name&gt;" "&lt;password&gt;" )
# Request IP
dhclient wlp3s0
# Confirm connection
ip addr show wlp3s0
</code></pre>
<p>Work on main interface (leave on a loop, in case wifi disconnects for whatever reason)</p>
<pre lang="bash"><code class="language-bash" lang="bash">while true; do dhclient -r eno1 ; dhclient eno1 ; ip addr show eno1; sleep 1; echo "DONE"; done
</code></pre>
<p>When done, showtdown wifi</p>
