<h1>Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuu (Opera)<a name="fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuopera"></a></h1>
<p>I hate ubuntu, but I hate windows the most. I hate firefox, but internet explorer makes me want to vomit. I don&rsquo;t like gnome, but kde is uglier. But I love Opera. Well, loved it, I guess version 10.60 will be my last version.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a loyal application which I&rsquo;ve been using since its 6.x version. Always fast, with all the functionality I needed (some more too) and none of the bloated BS needed to make FF be a usable (though ugly) browser. It had it&rsquo;s ussual screw-ups, everyone does, but after I updated to version 10.60 it has become unusable.</p>
<p>Its new features include random crashe, making gmail work really slow (or not at all: the fucking scrollbar won&rsquo;t work anymore, and keyboard shortcuts in google reader (j &amp; k, next &amp; prev) are foobar&rsquo;d. Scrolling on a large webpage eats 100% cpu, the upgrade fucked up my nice dark theme (and changed it back to a hellish abomination which seems to be a time-traveller from 1998), and it has random stupid bugs. And I mean STUPID, like, double click a word and the popup menu won&rsquo;t go away.</p>
<p>Fuck. I always liked you Opera, but it seems it may be time to give chrome a chance.</p>

<p>[&hellip;] current email count. It works on Opera but it makes it crash. Most likely the script is not the one to blame [&hellip;]</p>
