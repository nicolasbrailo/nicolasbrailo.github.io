<h1>Fixed string: POD String datatype<a name="fixedstringpodstringdatatype"></a></h1>
<p>We saw in <a href="/blog/2010/0407_PODtypesinC.html">POD types in C++</a> the difference between a POD and a non-POD type but the question of how to apply this knowledge to persist an std::string-like object remained open. This problem is a specific version of how to persist an object from which you know the size but has internal buffers using the heap instead of using only stack memory.</p>
<p>The best example for this case is, perhaps, a column from a table. You know the upper limit of the string&rsquo;s length but using std::string is clearly much better (easier) than a char[N]. Yet you&rsquo;d be loosing the ability to persist this object in a generic way (i.e. copying memory instead of knowing the object&rsquo;s internal structure).</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s an easy solution (though more than a solution I&rsquo;d call it an acceptable trade-off) in which you can create a char[N], a char buffer, with std::string-like behaviour and yet POD-safe (almost POD safe actually, as we&rsquo;ll see now).</p>
<h3>What&rsquo;s a POD?<a name="whatsapod"></a></h3>
<p>POD datatypes, though informally explained in &ldquo;<a href="/blog/2010/0407_PODtypesinC.html">POD types in C++</a>&rdquo; have a formal definition which you can look in Google. For practical terms a POD is a trivial object: no custom constructors, no virtual functions, nada of the fun stuff C++ can give you (or a native type, obviously).</p>
<p>Although this definition gives us quite a hard constraint we can create a quasi POD object (!) that does not conform to the standard definition of POD, yet has all the properties of one. This is the kind of struct we&rsquo;ll be creating. It would crash our program if used in a printf, but resides completly on the stack.</p>
<h3>Implementing a POD string<a name="implementingapodstring"></a></h3>
<p>A word of warning: ignore for now the &ldquo;template &rdquo; part; that&rsquo;s a template metaprogramming technique which we&rsquo;ll discuss some other day.</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">template  &amp;lt;int N&amp;gt; struct FixedString {
   mutable char str[N];
   FixedString() { str[0] = &#x27;X&#x27;; }
   FixedString(const char<em> rid){ memcpy(str, rid, sizeof(str)); }
   FixedString(const FixedString &amp;amp;rid){ memcpy(str, rid.str, sizeof(str)); }
   operator const char</em>() const { return str; }
};
</pre>
<p>You can see now why I called it a trade-off: it works as we intend it to work but it does have its rough edges (most notably the const char/mutable part). It&rsquo;ll allow you to use a char[N] with some behaviour of an std::string; use it with caution.</p>
