<p>Check out the following code:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">
struct Foo {
        struct Foobar{ Foobar(){ throw &quot;foobar&amp;#x27;d&quot;; } };
        Foobar baz;
        Foo() try : baz() {
                cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &quot;Ctr 1n&quot;;
        }catch(...){
                cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &quot;Ctr 2n&quot;;
        }
};
int main() {
        Foo bar;
        cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &quot;End!n&quot;;
        return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>Nice, isn't it? Without using a compiler answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it compile?</li>
<li>If it does, does it abort or does it return 0?</li>
<li>What does it print?</li>
</ul>
<p>Did you think about it? Come on, I'll wait... ready? OK, lets go.</p>
<p>First we should think about something else: what the fuck is that thing? I would surely be horrified if I found something like that was lurking in one of my projects' code. It's hideous. And it's called a "Constructor function-try-block" (yes, answering the first question, it does compile and it indeed is valid C++ code).</p>
<p>A constructor function-try-block exists only to catch exceptions thrown while constructing a composite object. This may tempt us to answer the second question: it should return 0, as we're catching Foobar's exception on Foo's ctr. But that's not how these things work , otherwise this would have been a very boring entry: the program aborts.</p>
<p>To understand why does this program abort you should think what does it mean to have a composite object; there is no meaning in having a Foo without a Foobar. baz, of type Foobar is a part of Foo, just like a head is a part of a person and there's no person without a head (though many act as if they didn't have a working head, but that is a topic for another day).</p>
<p>Now, what does it mean to throw (regardless wheter this is a good or a bad practice) in a constructor? It is like saying "There's been a horrible error and I have no idea how to recover. Man, I give up". Throwing in a ctr means there's no point in trying to fully construct that object: it leaves a half-built thing. What can you do with that half object? Nothing, throw it away.</p>
<p>Now that we know what does it mean to throw in a constructor we can answer why does the program abort: there is no point in building a composite object when one of its constituting parts can NOT be constructed, thus it must throw as well.</p>
<p>The last point, why do we have function try blocks if we can't catch exceptions? Well... you can't catch it but you may rethrow a different one, or use the constructor to clean up the mess you would otherwise leave behind. Or you could write a snippet of code, post it on your blog and confuse a whole lot of people (all 3 of them reading this block. Hi grandma).</p>
<p>Oh, we had a third question, but you should be able to answer that one yourself.</p>

<p>Remember my <a href="/blog/2009/0323_ValgrindOCISuppressionsfileFTW.html">OCI suppressions file</a>? Well, since then I have updated it. Now it includes some more suppressions, for <a href="http://www.net-snmp.org/">libnetsnmp</a>, Oracle, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/berkeley-db/index.html">Berkeley DB</a>, and may be something else I can't remember.</p>
<p>If you add anything else let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>BTW last time attaching this file failed so now I'm posting it in the first comment after this entry.</p>

<p>OK, the hiatus is over. It's not like I've been sitting around doing nothing this last couple of months... well may be I have, but now I'm back. Kind off, I'm actually going out on vacations a couple of weeks in march but the blog will be on autopilot&nbsp; and there are quite a lot of posts in the backlog... there are a couple of months more worth of clever and informative (?) articles, so stay tuned (?^2).</p>
