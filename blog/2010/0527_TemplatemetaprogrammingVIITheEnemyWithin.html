<h1>Template metaprogramming VII: The Enemy Within<a name="templatemetaprogrammingviitheenemywithin"></a></h1>
<p>Remember where were we last time? We had this code to define a list:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">struct NIL {
    typedef NIL Head;
    typedef NIL Tail;
};
template &amp;lt;typename H, typename T=NIL&amp;gt; struct Lst {
    typedef H Head;
    typedef T Tail;
};
template &amp;lt;int N&amp;gt; struct Int{ static const int result = N; };
typedef Lst&amp;lt; Int&amp;lt;1&amp;gt;, Lst&amp;lt; Int&amp;lt;2&amp;gt;, Lst&amp;lt; Int&amp;lt;3&amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; OneTwoThree;
</pre>
<p>Now, to increase our template-foo, let's practice some basic operations. The same operations you would implement to practice your skill any other functional language. If I remember correctly these where useful when learning Haskel: getting a list's lenght, getting the Nth element, appending and preppending elements... that sort of stuff.</p>
<p>Let's start with the most basic: getting the length of a list. We don't really have a for loop so using recursion is the only way. It gets easier if we think again on our definition of list: "think of a list as tuple, two elements, the first (called head) will be the first element of the list and the second element as another list or a NIL object". Whit this definition of a list, then it's length turns to be 1 (the head) + the length of the remaining list (the tail), with a special case for the length of a NIL object which should always be 0. In template-speak:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">template &amp;lt;typename LST&amp;gt; struct Length {
    typedef typename LST::Tail Tail;
    static const unsigned int tail_length = Length&amp;lt; Tail &amp;gt;::result;
    static const unsigned int result = 1 + tail_length;
};
template &amp;lt;&amp;gt; struct Length &amp;lt;NIL&amp;gt; {
    static const unsigned int result = 0;
};
</pre>
<p>I know. You are thinking "wait, what?". Well, even for this basic case we need to use some esoteric language features:</p>
<ul>
<li>typename is needed to tell the compiler LST::Tail is a type and not a static variable (like Length::result is). Did you remember that from <a href="/blog/2010/0506_TemplatemetaprogrammingIVNightmarestocome.html">chapter IV</a>?</li>
<li>We have to use recursive templates, but you probably already figured that out. You should remember this from <a href="/blog/2010/0422_TemplatemetaprogrammingIIOpenningthebox.html">chapter II</a>.</li>
<li>We can provide a spetialization of a template. You should also remember this from <a href="/blog/2010/0422_TemplatemetaprogrammingIIOpenningthebox.html">chapter II</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, you can write it this way too:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">template &amp;lt;typename LST&amp;gt; struct Length {
    static const unsigned int result = 1 + Length&amp;lt; typename LST::Tail &amp;gt;::result;
};
template &amp;lt;&amp;gt; struct Length  {
    static const unsigned int result = 0;
};
</pre>
<p>The rest of the "basic" list-operations are quite similar, but I'll leave that for another post.</p>
