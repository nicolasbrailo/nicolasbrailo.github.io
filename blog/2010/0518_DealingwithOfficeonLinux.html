<p>True, so true&hellip; It&rsquo;s been said a thousand times, but I kinda like ranting&hellip; like it or not Office files are a majority out there. If you work with Linux, using it in a real enterprise environment, sooner or later you&rsquo;ll run into someone using a propietary Office format. You&rsquo;ll also run into someone who doesn&rsquo;t know that you need OOO to open those weird odf files. You may need to produce an adecuately formated document sometime, and <a href="/search/label/LaTeX">LaTeX</a> may not be an option.</p>
<p>Deal with it. Install a VM, or Wine, and a copy of MS Office. Resistance is futile.</p>
