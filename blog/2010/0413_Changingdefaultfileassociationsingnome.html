<h1>Changing default file associations in gnome<a name="changingdefaultfileassociationsingnome"></a></h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since I posted a Linux related tip. Not in the mood I guess&hellip; well, this is one which really annoyed me, until I found out how easy it is: I hate some of the default file associations in gnome. Movieplayer, for example, is a horrible choice. Breaking and devolving with each new distro release, I have decided to settle with vlc as my default movie player, yet I couldn&rsquo;t easily change the default file type association. After fiddling around with the thingy in gnome resembling a regedit (ugh) I found out the easy way:</p>
<p>* Right click the file for which you want to change default associations and click properties
* Select &ldquo;open with&rdquo; tab
* &hellip;
* Profit!</p>
