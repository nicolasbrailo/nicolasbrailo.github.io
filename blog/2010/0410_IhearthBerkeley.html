<p>Thank you very much, Oracle Berkeley, for having a type named Db and another one named DB, and for never using namespaces. It makes my work a much more interesting challenge (*).</p>
<p>(*) Yeah, I know, Db is for the C++ wrapper and DB is for the plain C API (**). So what, I hate you all anyway.
(**) I'm working on a project with Berekley DB and it has enough WTF moments for a complete blog... I may post some of them, as a catharsis method. (***)
(***) Or because it has some interesting stuff too... who knows. Recursive note FTW (**). I think I have already done that, haven't I?</p>
