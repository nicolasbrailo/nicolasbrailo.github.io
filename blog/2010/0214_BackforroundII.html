<h1>Back for round II<a name="backforroundii"></a></h1>
<p>OK, the hiatus is over. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;ve been sitting around doing nothing this last couple of months&hellip; well may be I have, but now I&rsquo;m back. Kind off, I&rsquo;m actually going out on vacations a couple of weeks in march but the blog will be on autopilot&nbsp; and there are quite a lot of posts in the backlog&hellip; there are a couple of months more worth of clever and informative (?) articles, so stay tuned (?^2).</p>
