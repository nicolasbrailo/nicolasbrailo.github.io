<h2>C++ linking WTF</h2>

Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2010-09-07 - <a href="/blog/2010/0907_ClinkingWTF.html">Permalink</a> 

<p>It is a commonly accepted fact that a succesfuly compiled application serves as enough proof of its correctness, but common wisdom doesn't say a thing about linking. If you like linker WTF moments, you'll love this snippet. Can you guess why won't it compile?</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">struct Foo {
    static const int x = 0;
    static const int y = 1;
    int z(bool x){
        return (x)? Foo::x : Foo::y;
    }
};
int main() {
    Foo z;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; z.z(true);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Well, it does compile (gotcha!) but it just won't link. Yet it seems so simple... let's add some more mistery to this WTF moment, try this change:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">    int z(bool x){
        int t = Foo::x;
        return (x)? t : Foo::y;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Holy shit, now it compiles? WTF? Some more strangeness:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">    int z(bool){
        return (true)? Foo::x : Foo::y;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>And again, now it compiles. WTF? I'll make a final change, this one should give you a clue about why it won't compile. Revert all changes back to the original code but add this two lines after Foo:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">
const int Foo::x;
const int Foo::y;
</code></pre>
<p>Though weird at first, now you should have a clear picture:
* The first case doesn't compiles: x and y are declared in struct Foo, yet the linker doesn't know in which translation unit they should be allocated.
* The second and third cases... well I'm not sure why does this compiles but it's probably because the linker can asume in which translation unit x and y should be allocated. I'm to lazy to check.
* In the last case we explicitly say where should x and y be. According to standard, this is how these two ints should be declared.</p>
<p>So, some linker strangeness. Beware, it's easy to get trapped by this one.</p>

<p>"The second and third cases&hellip; well I’m not sure why does this compiles but it’s probably because the linker can asume in which translation unit x and y should be allocated. I’m to lazy to check."</p>
<p>The difference probably has to do with the optimizer. If the optimizer reduces all references to the static variable to a compile time constant then there are no references to the non-existant variable for the linker to complain about.</p>
<p>You can see these kinds of linker bugs happen often in debug builds but not in release builds because of different optimization levels.</p>
