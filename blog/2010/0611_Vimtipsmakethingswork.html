<h1>Vim tips: make things work<a name="vimtipsmakethingswork"></a></h1>
<p>So, you are an uber console geek, using only vim and the command line to compile all your projects, execute the tests, blah blah blah&hellip; if only you could squeeze that microsecond lost whenever you switch from vim to compile you&rsquo;d be 1e-4 seconds more productive&hellip; oh, wait, you can!</p>
<p>Whenever you think you&rsquo;re project is good enough to compile just hit <strong>:make</strong> to be proven wrong. Type <strong>:make test</strong> to run your tests (because you are using TDD, aren&rsquo;t you?) and watch all those red flags fly by.Also, add the following mapping to your ~/.vimrc for an extra happy coding session:</p>
<pre lang="bash" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">map &lt;F5&gt; :make
map &lt;F6&gt; :make test
</pre>
