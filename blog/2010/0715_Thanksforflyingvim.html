<h1>Thanks for flying vim<a name="thanksforflyingvim"></a></h1>
<p>Have you ever used Vim through ssh and saw your xterm title changes to &ldquo;Thanks for flying vim&rdquo;? It happens a lot to me, and I usualy notice about an hour later. I&rsquo;m not sure what&rsquo;s the use of this, I guess it&rsquo;s related to Vim airlines (no, really, check <a href="/blog/youfoundadeadlink.html">vim-avia.com</a>), but it can be turned off:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When using vim in an xterm it renames the title of that window to &ldquo;Thanks for flying vim&rdquo; on exit.</p>
<p>Q: How to turn off the message &ldquo;Thanks for flying vim&rdquo;?
A: :set notitle</p>
