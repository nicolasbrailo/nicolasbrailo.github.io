<h1>MySQL upsert, Oracle merge<a name="mysqlupsertoraclemerge"></a></h1>
<p>How many times have you seen this "pattern"?</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">unsigned int row_count = foo-&amp;gt;update();
if (row_count == 0) {
   foo-&amp;gt;insert();
}
</pre>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice if you could write all that in a single line? Say, something like</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">foo-&amp;gt;update_or_insert_if_it_doesnt_exists();
</pre>
<p>Well, good news, you can! Obviously it's not standard SQL, nothing useful ever is, but even so I think using an upsert (who comes up with those names?) can be quite good for your health.</p>
<p>So, how do you use it? It's easy;</p>
<pre lang="sql" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">INSERT INTO Table ( col1, col2 )
SELECT &#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;b&#x27;
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE col1 = &#x27;a&#x27;, col2 = &#x27;b&#x27;;
</pre>
<p>Go on, try it, I'll wait. What? It didn't work? Oh, I forgot, you need to create a unique key so the engine can recognize when there is a duplicate key (say, 'create index unique on col1'). Try it now.</p>
<p>Nice, isn't it? Oracle has its own version of upsert, called merge (at least the name is better) but it itches a little bit when I write about Oracle, so go and check <a href="http://psoug.org/reference/merge.html">this page</a> instead.</p>
