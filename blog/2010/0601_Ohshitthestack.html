<h2>Oh shit, the stack</h2>

Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2010-06-01 - <a href="/blog/2010/0601_Ohshitthestack.html">Permalink</a> 

<p>Post from the wayback machine. I wrote this a long time ago but it got way down the posts queue, don't know why</p>
<p>I liked my vacations very much, thank you. Some people enjoyed vacations from me too. At work they even decided to keep this gem for my return. Upon my arrival a nice coredump was waiting at my desk, so to speak. Check it out, isn't it beautiful?</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">0 0xff05d070 in inflate_fast () from /usr/lib/libz.so
1 0xff05a13c in inflate () from /usr/lib/libz.so
2 0x00146224 in ZDecompress::decompress (this=0xfbc7b300, sauce=@0xfbe7b740, dest=@0x27c910) at Compressor.h:134
3 0x00145e80 in HandleClient::get_client_data (this=0x27c810, output_stream=0x27c910) at IPC/DataReceiver.cpp:54
</code></pre>
<p>Yeah, that's getting killed inside zlib. Nice way to start the year, a bug in zlib. What led me to that conclusion? Easy, the same compressed file worked in Ubuntu. Must be a bug in zlib then!</p>
<p>The next step was getting zlib's code and adding enough printf's to know the problem was in the middle of the file, not at the beginning nor the end; indeed, most of the file could be correctly decoded, but then it just died. This looked more and more like a bug in zlib.</p>
<p>I began to scramble things around, trying to isolate the problem. Things just got weirder, the same code worked fine if instead of being inside a thread I was on the main thread. If you have psychic powers you now have enough information to know what the problem was. Although I should have known too (this wasn't even the first time I saw a problem like this one!) I was mindset on finding a bug in zlib, which now, it seems, only appears while interacting with ACE (in my defence, I did see these kind of bugs too).</p>
<p>Fiddling around with the code some more, even stranger backtraces began to appear. First this one:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
[Switching to LWP 10]
0xfd6b88fc in _pollsys () from /usr/lib/libc.so.1
(gdb) bt
#0  0xfd6b88fc in _pollsys () from /usr/lib/libc.so.1
#1  0x696e7661 in ?? ()
#2  0x696e7661 in ?? ()
</code></pre>
<p>And then this other one, which led me into the right direction:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
[Switching to LWP 9]

<p>That last stack trace got me to think how could it be possible for an otherwise working program to coredump while creating an stdlib object. I mean, stdlib is quite well tested, isn't it? Then it struck me: the keyword isn't stdlib but <strong>creating</strong>. It was allocating memory from the stack, upon entering the function.</p>
<p>Some more research later I found out that Solaris default thread size is about 1 mb, while in Ubuntu this thread is of about 8 mb. And I also noticed the buffer I was allocating for zlib was taking up space in... the stack.</p>
<p>If there's something to learn from this story is that you should always know what goes in the stack: only small objects should live there, and you should always know the max stack depth a function could reach. Otherwise it may come back and bite you in the ass when you're back from your vacations.</p>

<p>Thanks for this post. As soon as I saw the title in Google I clued in to what I'd done :)</p>

<p>I'm glad to know I'm not the only one who finds (and makes) these kind of bugs lol</p>
