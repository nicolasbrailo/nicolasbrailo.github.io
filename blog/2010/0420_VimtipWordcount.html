<h1>Vim tip: Word count<a name="vimtipwordcount"></a></h1>
<p>Trying to count words is a common task. Whenever you&rsquo;re writting a report for class, that is. There are some legitimate reasons but they don&rsquo;t matter now: it&rsquo;s a great chance to show off how great Vim is.</p>
<p>First method: Type ggVgY&rdquo;*p to copy the whole text. Then paste it into word and use word count.</p>
<p>Second method: Type %!wc -w, which executes wc on each line.
Third method: Type g^g (g, CTRL+g) and watch the bottom of your screen.</p>
<p>As ussual, Vim rocks.</p>
