<li>Do you try to keep your inbox count in 0 (but usually fail miserably)?</li>
<li>Do you like (need!) to be notified when a new mail arrives?</li>
<li>Do you like Opera?</li>
</ul>

In the meantime, go and check <a href="/blog/youfoundadeadlink.html">Gmail Favicon Alerts 3</a>, a cool script which changes gmails favicon to show your current email count.
