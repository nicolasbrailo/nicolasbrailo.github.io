<h1>POD types in C++<a name="podtypesinc"></a></h1>
<p>Let's say you have something like this:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">typedef int A;
void x(A);
struct B {
   int b;
   B(int b) : b(b) {}
   virtual void x() = 0;
};
</pre>
<p>Regardless of what does function x do, what's the difference between A and B? Without getting too picky and leaving semantics aside, we may say there is no difference in behaviour. There's however a small gotcha there, which is completely irrelevant for C++ code but can bite you in the ass when interfacing C and C++. Would this work?</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">{
   A a; B b;
   // Case 1
   A <em>p = malloc(sizeof(A));
   memcpy(p, &amp;amp;a, sizeof(A));
   // Case 2
   B </em>p = malloc(sizeof(B));
   memcpy(p, &amp;amp;b, sizeof(B));
}
</pre>
<p>The answer is perhaps. In most cases it would work, in some cases it won't. C++ uses a vtable to dispatch virtual methods, so if I were to perform a memcpy of an object, then store it on disk and retrieve it afterwards I don't have any guarantees the vtable will still be valid. And that's leaving aside the case of objects having dynamically allocated memory themselves.</p>
<p>Wrapping up, the difference between A and B is simple: A is a POD (Plain Old Datatype, POJO for you Java guys) type, B is not. There are some other things non-POD objects can't do, for example this is invalid:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">   B b;
   printf(&quot;%i&quot;, b);
</pre>
<p>Not only it's invalid: g++ emits a warning and then crashes on runtime (this is related to the use of vargs in functions with "..." params, but it's not important now).</p>
<p>Knowing what a POD object is, what would you do now if you had to persist (serialize) an std::string-like object? That's a topic for the next post.</p>
