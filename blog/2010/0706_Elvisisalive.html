<h1>Elvis is alive!<a name="elvisisalive"></a></h1>
<p>Unix trivia day: in the olden days of the 90&rsquo;s there were a lot of Unix boxes out there named &ldquo;elvis&rdquo;. Nowdays it&rsquo;s not uncommon to find one, either. Have you ever wondered why are there so many boxes called elvis?</p>
<p>This is related to Solaris&rsquo; ping command. When you ping $HOST it prints &ldquo;$HOST is alive&rdquo; (if it&rsquo;s responding the pings), thus elvis is alive!</p>
