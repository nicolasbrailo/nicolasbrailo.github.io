<h1>Elvis is alive!<a name="elvisisalive"></a></h1>
<p>Unix trivia day: in the olden days of the 90's there were a lot of Unix boxes out there named "elvis". Nowdays it's not uncommon to find one, either. Have you ever wondered why are there so many boxes called elvis?</p>
<p>This is related to Solaris' ping command. When you ping $HOST it prints "$HOST is alive" (if it's responding the pings), thus elvis is alive!</p>
