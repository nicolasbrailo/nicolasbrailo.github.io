<p>This is the end. My only reader, the end. After 15 chapters of template metaprogramming you should have learned why staying away from them is a good idea, but if you have been following this series then you should know now when and why they could be useful.</p>
<p>These posts were a compendium of mostly isolated data I found during my travels through the depths of metaprogramming tricks, there are books and people much more capable than me if you want to learn more about this subject (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_C%2B%2B_Design">Modern C++ Design by Andrei Alexandrescu</a> comes to mind).</p>
<p>The whole idea of having a cache and a virtual template method was nice, but after seeing the result I decided it was best to have a factory method and an IDL. It may not be so l33t, but whoever has to maintain the code after me will be grateful.</p>
<p>This is the last post on this topic because I feel I have written most, if not everything, I can transmit through this medium but also for an important reason, most likely I won't be working with C++ code so much from now on [1] so there won't be as many chances for me to see the dark, insane, side of this beautiful (in its own way) programming language in a programming language. I know most of you must have barely skimmed through these articles, but I still hope you enjoyed them.</p>
<p>[1] That's right, I'm leaving C++ for the dark side of development, I'll be working with Java from now on. Keep in mind this article may have been written a long time before it's published.</p>
<p>[2] Wow, it was a long time since I used the meta-post category</p>
