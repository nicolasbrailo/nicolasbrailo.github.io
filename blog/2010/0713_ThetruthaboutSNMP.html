<h1>The truth about SNMP<a name="thetruthaboutsnmp"></a></h1>

<blockquote>
<p>After years thinking and reading RFCs and various other documents, today, I finally understood. &ldquo;Simple&rdquo; refers to &ldquo;Network&rdquo; not to &ldquo;Management Protocol&rdquo;! So it is a Management Protocol for Simple Networks not a Simple Protocol for Management of Networks&hellip; That explains why it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Simple&rdquo;. It was that Simple but it took me years to understand it! &ndash; LuisOntanon</p>
