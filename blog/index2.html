<h2>Mixin(ish) classes with parameter packs in C++<a name="mixinishclasseswithparameterpacksinc"></a></h2>

<p>For some reason I couldn't find many examples of how to use a parameter pack as a mixin, to enable different features with no runtime overhead. Here is a full example of you might implement this (be aware there are some nasal daemons in the code below!). The technique is really based on this one line:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++"> int dummy[sizeof...(Config)] = { (Config::apply(p), 0)... };
</code></pre>
<p>This idiom will unpack a parameter pack and call T::apply, for each T in the parameter pack. You can use this idiom to build very clean mixin-type interfaces with static dispatch, or to build job security.</p>
<p>Full example:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">struct EnableFeatureA {
  template &lt;typename T&gt; static void apply(T *a) {
    cout &lt;&lt; a-&gt;a() &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
};
struct EnableFeatureB {
  template &lt;typename T&gt; static void apply(T *a) {
    cout &lt;&lt; T::b() &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
};
template &lt;typename Impl, typename... Config&gt;
struct Foo {
  Foo(){
    // Call apply() for each type in Config
    Impl *p = nullptr;
    int dummy[sizeof...(Config)] = { (Config::apply(p), 0)... };
  }
};
struct Bar;
using FwdFoo = Foo&lt;Bar, EnableFeatureA, EnableFeatureB&gt;;
struct Bar : FwdFoo {
   int a() { return 4; }
   static int b() { return 2; }
};
</code></pre>

<p>I spent the last few years in a role that required a significant part in communicating with other people. Some of that in the form of slides and presentations, because not having slides isn't enterprisy. I'm far from being a great presenter, but I did learn a thing or two. All this is quite general, so it should apply to any kind of topic... as long as that topic is software engineering. I'm still a technical person and an engineer, so a lot of my assumptions about the audience may not hold true if you, for example, need to seriously consider fun things like workplace politics.</p>
<p>I hope these tips become useful for other people. At the very least I hope I'll remember to re-read this post the next time I have to present something.</p>
<h2>Tip 1: Your audience wants you to succeed<a name="tip1youraudiencewantsyoutosucceed"></a></h2>
<p>This is perhaps the most groundbreaking revelation. When you present something, people are giving you their time. Instead of browsing memes they are sitting down, listenning to what you have to say (at least until their limited attention span runs out). Nearly all of your audience will want to learn something, have fun, or at least be entretained. In a large enough crowd, the majority will be there voluntarily. There is just one logical conclusion: they want you to succeed! Few will go there with the expectation that your presentation will suck; that would be wasted time for them too.</p>
<h2>Tip 2: Your audience wants you to succeed. Except for *that person*.<a name="tip2youraudiencewantsyoutosucceed.exceptforthatperson."></a></h2>
<p>Ok, tip #1 needs a caveat: *that person*. Most people will want to enjoy your presentation as much as they can and move on to the next thing. Except there will always be that person. You know who; might just be schadenfreude, or maybe they like showing off "they know best". Whatever the reason, they'll have a nitpick, an impossible question or an "actually" to add. There's good news, though: everyone dislikes him!</p>
<p>Whenever the annoying person of the group raises their hand, there's usually a collective sigh and a lot of eye-rolling in the audience. Don't invest most of your energy in dealing with that person. Do pay attention to the issues this person raises; they may in fact be good objections. Just learn how to defer. 99% of the time it suffices to say "good observation, let's pick it up one-on-one after this presentation". The audience is happy, the person raising the question feels heard and you may actually learn something new from the interaction.</p>
<h2>Tip 3: Understand your medium<a name="tip3understandyourmedium"></a></h2>
<p>A long time ago I thought slides were slides were slides. And a presentation is the decoration on top. Big mistake! The first thing I learned -the hard way- is that presentations, and in particular slides, need to be tailored to your delivery medium. Doing an online webcast presentation is very different than doing a presentation in person. It's even harder if you have a mixed audience, with some people online and some people in person. I personally try to avoid this situation like hell, as the end result tends to be a session that's not quite good for anyone. I prefer to have two sessions, one in person only and one just online. Some people are capable of having a successful presentation with a mixed audience. I'm not that skilled.</p>
<h2>Tip 4: Give your audience a break<a name="tip4giveyouraudienceabreak"></a></h2>
<p>You know your presentation. You've practiced, know the material, understand every nook and cranny of your talk. However, for your audience it's (hopefully) all new knowledge. And it's hard to absorb new knowledge with a person talking non stop, all the time. Give your audience a pause. Let them think. *Stay silent*.</p>
<p>It sounds scary: being on the spotlight, standing up and not saying anything for *minutes*. Well, it may seem like minutes, but it's usually just a few seconds you need: that's usually enough for people to think through a new idea. Learn to be comfortable with a bit of silence.</p>
<h2>Tip 5: Silence for emphasis<a name="tip5silenceforemphasis"></a></h2>
<p>Silence is important, so it gets two tips. People need silence to think, sure. But also consider this: while you shut up, people think of what you last said (or dinner, depending on the talk). That means, if you need to emphazise a particular aspect of your talk don't repeat it over and over again; present it, then make a pause. Just 5 seconds. If you quickly move on it becomes another bit of information in a sea of new knowledge. Stop for emphasis.</p>
<h2>Tip 6: Questions?<a name="tip6questions"></a></h2>
<p>In light of all the praise of silence, here's an extra beneffit of shutting up: people get to ask questions. Yes, that's also scary, but interaction is great to help people understand. Invite questions with your silence!</p>
<p>Yes, an open conversation is scary. Besides the job of presenting you're now also a moderator. It can derail the whole timing and it makes presenting that much harder. So what? Your presentation may be good but it's not *that good*: if your audience engages you're doing something right. Follow their lead.</p>
<p>The difficult part is learning when to stop a runaway discussion. As a general rule, if you see engagement from different people across the room you're doing fine. If you only see a small group of people nitpicking over a detail, it's time to stop (remember tip #2!)</p>
<h2>Tip 7: Most important slide? Last one<a name="tip7mostimportantslidelastone"></a></h2>
<p>The last slide will be shown the longest. While you get closing questions from the audience (or akwardly stand in a corner while saying "no questions?", whichever happens) the final slide will be on screen. People will now either stare at their phones or ar this final slide. Make it count! Don't use a "Questions?" clipart (please don't use clipart). Make the last slide a summary of the most relevant point of your talk. Add some followup links and contact information.</p>
<p>If there is only one slide your audience will remember (and you may not even get that) it will probably be the last one.</p>
<h2>Tip 8: Paper drafts<a name="tip8paperdrafts"></a></h2>
<p>Some times a computer is too limiting. Start with a paper draft to organize your ideas. Maybe you can also draw a mock of a few important slides. You don't need to design the entire thing on paper but by not having to fight your tools (is this image *really* aligned with that text?) you can focus on content, then on "UX" and only then on the implementation. If you run out of time battling powerpoint you can still have good content. If you run out of time battling powerpoint while designing your third slide, you may have a brilliant presentation with 10% of the content you wanted to show.</p>
<h2>Tip 9: Know your audience *and yourself*<a name="tip9knowyouraudienceandyourself"></a></h2>
<p>Some presentations are good for jokes and an informal tone. Some are to present quarterly financial numbers to your board of directors. It's pretty clear in which one you can use cat memes (and if it's not, maybe you need to start smaller!) - but you should also know to which style of presentation you naturally lean.</p>
<p>Slides are boring but safe. Q&amp;A's are good to let people understand a topic at their own pace. Videos are a safe back up, but hard to seamlessly integrate in a presentation. Jokes are great, but really hard if you're not familiar with the audience. Know which style works for you and rely on it; but also try to mix in some new skill you are trying to develop. You may be surprised.</p>
<h2>Tip 10: Why are you there? Why are they there?<a name="tip10whyareyoutherewhyaretheythere"></a></h2>
<p>Before even planning a presentation, ask yourself: why? What's the purpose, what do *I* want to get out of it? More importantly: what do other people get out of it? The first reaction is usually "sharing information!". Unless you are a particularly skilled presenter, the information you had to share can probably be better understood by writing down a whitepaper, or maybe just an email.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to present something, from getting people to sit-down-and-pay-attention to "listen to my amazing sales pitch". In the end most of them boil down to some form of entertainment. Yes: most (successful) presentations are just some form of amusement. If you also have a useful message to deliver with it, all the better!</p>

<h2>Bash tip: Default value for a variable<a name="bashtipdefaultvalueforavariable"></a></h2>

<p>In my Bash scripts, I used to hack my way around default values for variables. Turns out there is a very simple way to give your variables a default value while also letting other override them if they want to:</p>
<pre><code>FOO=${BAR-bar}
</code></pre>
<p>If someone export's BAR, then FOO will equals the already exported value of $BAR, if $BAR doesn't exist then FOO will have the value of the literal 'bar'.</p>

<p>Let's pretend you find this:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">const int a = foo();
int b = foo();
</code></pre>
<p>Would you be tempted to assume that a==b, always? I would. What if 'foo' actually depends on a global variable, and its return value depends on that global setting? Suddenly the code above will raise a few eyebrows in a code review session.</p>
<p>Coming to your friendly c++20 standard now:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">constexpr int foo() {
    return (std::is_constant_evaluated())? 42 : 24;
}
bool a() {
    const int x = foo();
    return x == foo();
}
</code></pre>
<p>I'm sure with careful usage, is_constant_evaluated will allow library writers to create much more performant code. I'm also sure I'll lose a lot of hair trying to figure out why my debug code (<code>cout &lt;&lt; foo()</code>, anyone?) prints different values than my <code>production</code> code.</p>

<p>I keep forgetting about this one. Maybe writing it down will help me remember: Vim can search for (and highlight) multiple patterns at the same time. Just start your search with \v and split the patterns with |. Eg:</p>

<h2>Bash: Color in command line prompt PS1<a name="bashcolorincommandlinepromptps1"></a></h2>
<p>Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2019-07-18 | <a href="/blog/2019/0718_BashColorincommandlinepromptPS1.html">Permalink</a>  | <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/nicolasbrailo.github.io/issues/new?title=Comment@/blog/2019/0718_BashColorincommandlinepromptPS1.html&amp;body=I%20have%20a%20comment!">Leave a comment</a></p>
<p>I'm lately dealing with lots of hosts in different environments (eg local, dev, test, etc). Some actions are safe to perform in some of these hosts, in others not so much. To help quickly figure out which hosts are safe, I wanted to add a color to my Bash prompt (PS1) - for example green for dev, where it's unlikely I'll break anything other than my stuff, red for hosts where carelessness might result in a weekend spent at the office.</p>
<p>The first result I get in Google when trying to set Bash's PS1 to use colors seems to be wrong (or, rather, I wasn't smart enough to make it work). An escape sequence seems to be missing, resulting in weird behavior with new lines; colors work, but line wrapping gets broken. Took me a while to associate broken \n's with colors, but once I did the fix was easy. Check out here for the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/342093/ps1-line-wrapping-with-colours-problem">proper way to escape color commands in Bash</a>.</p>
<p>And here's my current setup:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">export COLOR_SET='\[\e['$THIS_HOST_COLOR'm\]'
export COLOR_RESET='\[\e[0m\]'
# Example:
export PS1='\A '$COLOR_SET'\h'$COLOR_RESET':\w$ '

<h2>The bestest autocomplete for Vim<a name="thebestestautocompleteforvim"></a></h2>

<p>TL;DR: I like <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe">YouCompleteMe</a>
A <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19529557">post in Hacker News</a> drew me to look at autocompletion in Vim. After trying a few plugins years before, I settled for the available-by-default autocomplete in Vim. It's pretty dumb, but pretty dumb covers 90% of what I need: autocompletionForReallyUglyOrLongNames.</p>
<p>Vim's omnifunc completer is enough if no fancy features are necessary: fast, available, trivial to setup. I have successfully used omnifunc in fairly large projects, and while it requires familiarity with the codebase, some may argue that's a feature and not a bug.</p>
<p>Now I confess: I don't understand Vundle, Pathogen or any other Vim plugin handler. Second extravagant opinion in this post: I don't see the point of a plugin manager for Vim. I like knowing the source code of every plugin I use well enough so I can troubleshoot it when it breaks (*). I prefer to #include (or, rather, source) them manually. Keeping <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/Nico.rc">everything in Github</a>, I rarely need to set up a plugin twice. The effort to install and configure a plugin is usually not a lot more than learning how to use that plugin in the first place.</p>
<p>While being Vundle illiterate may have made my experience a bit more complicated than necessary, I still found the experience of installing autocompletion plugins quite horrible (#). <a href="https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim">Deoplete</a> had me chasing dependencies all over the place and Conquer of Completion seems to require such specific setup of version and plugins that I didn't even attempt to install it.</p>
<p>YouCompleteMe, though, was a pleasant surprise: its documentation explained how to install in three steps, and it is a mostly self-contained plugin. While YCM has a compiled dependency, setting it up is pretty trivial. It just works out of the box.</p>
<p>Took me years but I'm very happy to finally find an autocomplete plugin that "just works" for my basic Vim setup.</p>
<p>(*) For some reason, I only feel this way about Vim</p>
<p>(#) Disclaimer: Re-reading my own text, it may appear as I'm somewhat belittling Deoplete, CoC, Vundle, Pathogen, etc. That's not my intention. I have the maximum respect for these projects. The engineering effort in them is amazing, and I know for a fact they make life easier for a lot of people. I'm just not one of them.</p>

<h2>Howto: shutdown a TV with HDMI CEC Chromecast<a name="howtoshutdownatvwithhdmicecchromecast"></a></h2>

<p>That's a long title just to say "how to turn off your TV". Only I want to show how to do it even if you lost your remote control.</p>
<p>Chromecast can turn your TV on and off, as long as it supports something called HDMI CEC. Of course the Chromecast itself needs to be powered, i.e. you can't plug it to a USB port in your TV.</p>
<p>The "on" part is easy: you just start casting something (<a href="/blog/2019/0405_ChromecasticSlideshow.html">your pictures, for example</a>) and Chromecast automagically turns your TV on. The off part is a bit harder.</p>
<p>Turning off is, obviously, an implemented feature, as the Google assistant can do it. After some Wireshark sniffing, I couldn't find any URL you can call in a Chromecast to turn off the TV. Some <a href="https://github.com/balloob/pychromecast/issues/196">people invested more time on this than me</a>, so I assume there's just no simple way to directly use a Chromecast for this. Luckily you can use the Google assistant.</p>
<p>I wrote "simple way". The following maybe doesn't quite qualify as "simple", but it's not too time consuming. It's certainly not elegant, but hey (as of the date I'm writing this article) it works.</p>
<h2>How to turn a TV off using a Chromecast<a name="howtoturnatvoffusingachromecast"></a></h2>
<h3>Part 1: Set up the Google assistant SDK<a name="part1setupthegoogleassistantsdk"></a></h3>
<p>There's no easy way to make a Chromecast turn off a TV, so instead we'll interface with a Google assistant, then ask the assistant to do it for us. There's also no easy way to do this with an API, but the assistant's voice recognition is actually quite good. Let's start by installing the SDK:</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow the setup instructions for the <a href="https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/guides/library/python/embed/setup">Google Assistant library</a>, with the changes described below.</li>
<li>The assistant examples need a microphone present, but we're not going to use it. If you don't have one and you're doing this in a RaspberryPi, just fake one by putting this in ~/.asoundrc:</li>
</ol>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">pcm.!default {
  type asym
  capture.pcm "mic"
}
pcm.mic {
  type plug
  slave {
    pcm "null"
  }
}
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>The same may be needed for a speaker.</li>
<li>Continue the setup guide: create a project in the Actions console. Register also a dummy model to download the json credentials.</li>
<li>Follow the "Install the SDK and Sample Code" instructions. In May 2019, they work fine in a RaspberryPI 3 with Raspbian.</li>
<li>Try running the sample code. googlesamples-assistant-hotword segfaults but googlesamples-assistant-pushtotalk works fine.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Part 2: Hack the sample to turn off a TV<a name="part2hackthesampletoturnoffatv"></a></h3>
<p>You should now have the samples from the SDK running. At least those that don't crash. If you have a microphone, you can ask anything you normally ask the Google assistant like... the weather?</p>
<p>The assistant can turn off your TV if you say "Turn off $Chromecast_Name". But what if you don't like talking to your phone?</p>
<p>I'm sure you expect I'll reveal a nice, clean way to invoke the assistant and make it turn off your Chromecast. Sorry, that would take too long. There is a text interface for the assistant but I wasn't able to have it running in less than 15 minutes, so these are your options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use festival. echo "$Google assistant command" | text2wave -o cmd.wav will generate a command that (often) the assistant can understand. If you don't have such luck:</li>
<li>Just record yourself. Hackish? Sure, but if all you need is to shut down a TV, that's enough. <strong>Important note</strong>: Record yourself in mono 16KHz. Otherwise the assistant may not understand the wav file. If you run "file command.wav" it should look like this:</li>
</ul>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">command.wav: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft PCM, 16 bit, mono 16000 Hz
</code></pre>
<p>Whatever method you choose, create a wav file with the command you want to execute (i.e. "turn off $Chromecast_name) and put it in the directory where you installed the Google Assistant SDK.</p>
<h3>Part 3: Throw your remote to the recycling bin!<a name="part3throwyourremotetotherecyclingbin"></a></h3>
<p>You're ready now. Goto the directory where you installed the SDK and recorded your voice command, then try this:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code class="language-c++" lang="c++">$ source env/bin/activate
$ googlesamples-assistant-pushtotalk --device-model-id $AN_ID_YOU_GOT_FROM_GOOGLE --project-id $YOUR_GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID --once --verbose -i ./command.wav
</code></pre>
<p>With a bit of luck that should shut down your TV.</p>

<p>As software developers, we need to put much more emphasis on positive interactions with our peers. Engineering requires critical thinking. Looking for cases where something (code!) will break. Criticizing what we do, on the hope of doing it better, is a key and necessary aspect of our profession. However, even when done properly (already a hard enough job!) this practice emphasizes negative interactions. In a normal job, what would you say is the ratio of times you hear "this might be better if .." vs "I really liked X"?</p>
<p>Saying "this was good" is hard. More often than not, it's hard to even notice good code (and I'd go as far as saying that noticing good things is hard in general!). Unlike criticism, positive interactions don't lead to direct improvements. No code will be enhanced by saying "I liked this solution", though people may be more inclined to considering criticism if the positive aspect is also noted.</p>
<p>In the end, maybe someone just had a slightly better day because you said something nice. That's already a small victory.</p>
