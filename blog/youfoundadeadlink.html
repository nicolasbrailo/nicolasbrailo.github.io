<h1>You found a dead link!<a name="youfoundadeadlink"></a></h1>
<p>This blog is, by Internet standards, ancient. The link you clicked probably worked a few years (decades) ago, but is now broken. Its content may be irretrievably lost forever. Or maybe the link still works, but I broke it in one of the many, many, blog migrations. We will never know, so here is the image of a kitten.</p>
