<div class="post">
<p>If you're reading this, you somehow found me at <a href="https://nicolasbrailo.github.io/blog">nicolasbrailo.github.io</a>. Maybe you came here from <a href="/blog/2024/0218_MovedAgain.html">one of my many previous blogs</a>, and you're marveling at the beautiful new design (?). As I alluded to in the <a href="/blog/2024/0218_MovedAgain.html">"moved again"</a> note, this site is built from a source of md files, <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/MdlogGen">using a custom md-to-html enginge</a>. If you're sane, you're probably why I would create an md-to-html engine, instead of using one of the many available options.</p>
<h2>MdlogGen: yet another MD site generator<a name="mdloggenyetanothermdsitegenerator"></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/MdlogGen">MdlogGen</a> is a simple md-to-static-html, however it supports a few features I wasn't able to find elsewhere: comments, and site-search. MdlogGen depends on Github for these two features (or, rather, depends on the viewer to have a Github account to be able to use these two features).</p>
<p>MdlogGen also supports the exact feature set I need, no more and no less; while using an off-the-shelf generator may have been a better longer term investment, 90% for the raison d'etre of this site is "for fun", and spending a weekend writing hacky code is more fun than spending a weekend trying to figure out how to configure Github deploy rules, and learning to use a third party content generator. I get to write enough code for a living during the week - weekends are for fun code! An alternate reason is that I already had to spend a chunk of time cleaning XML exports from my previous sites to build this one - so MdlogGen is sort of a natural evolution of those scripts. Kind of.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/MdlogGen">MdlogGen</a>'s reamde: while many other md-to-html generators exist, I think this may be one of the simplest feature-complete generators out there.</p>
