<h1>Move again<a name="moveagain"></a></h1>
<p>I'm now at <a href="https://nicolasbrailo.github.io/blog">nicolasbrailo.github.io</a>. If I count platform, domain or tech-stack changes as a migration, I've now lost count of how many this site has had. It's the third one in the last few years. I moved away from WP because I wasn't happy with the sponsored content added to my site. I also wasn't happy with Blogger, I never quite like the interface, the way to write posts, or the customization options.</p>
<p>This site now came full circle: it started as a self-hosted php bundle, and it's now a kind-of-self-hosted static html site, <a href="https://github.com/nicolasbrailo/nicolasbrailo.github.io">generated from .md files in Github</a>. I figured I'm the person who reads this site the most, so I should like it. I'm a nerd, so I like writing code; hence the custom md-to-html converter, about which I should blog some time soon. This is also only meant as a fun project (and a great self-reminder mechanism, persistent through the decades) so why not reinvent the wheel, and create a custom md-to-html renderer for it?</p>
<h2>ToDo<a name="todo"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>RSS doesn't work yet</li>
<li>There are broken things from back the 2010's - I need to review old posts</li>
<li>Some content isn't migrated yet</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fun stats<a name="funstats"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>There are about 450 posts, in about 15 years. This means I'm quite lazy.</li>
<li>Most of the external links are actually broken. If you browse the site, you'll notice the further back in time you go, the more dead links you get. This site has survived a non trivial chunk of the existing Internet.</li>
<li>This blog started some time in 2008, and since then has had at least 5 domains (but possibly more)<ul>
<li>nicolasb[com.ar]</li>
<li>monosinfinitos[com.ar]</li>
<li>monoinfinito.wordpress.com</li>
<li>monkeywritescode.blogspot.com</li>
<li>Now: <a href="https://nicolasbrailo.github.io/blog">nicolasbrailo.github.io</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally deleted all content from Wordpress - just today!</li>
<li>I moved away from Wordpress in 2021. Somehow, the site still claims to have 20 visitors a day, even though there are no posts (other than a text saying "moved to...")</li>
<li>I still haven't deleted all the content from Blogger - but it's in my ToDo list</li>
<li><code>wc $(find blog_md -type f)</code> says this blog has 116068 words in 16497 lines. This is comparable to 400 pages book, though not necessarily a good one. Google says 'The Return of the King' is about 135K words, and 'The Hobbit' is about 100K. 'Sense and Sensibility' comes closest at 119K words.</li>
</ul>
