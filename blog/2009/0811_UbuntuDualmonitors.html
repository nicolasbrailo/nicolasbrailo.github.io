<h1>Ubuntu: Dual monitors<a name="ubuntudualmonitors"></a></h1>
<p>There's nothing better than feeling like a super villain by having a dual monitor setup. OK, three may be better, you probably couldn't hold back the evil laughter, but my laptop won't support three screens.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in Ubuntu JJ having a dual screen setup is a breeze. Just <strong>plug the two monitors</strong> and hope it works. Of course, it may not. If that's the case you can go to <strong>System &gt; Preferences &gt; Screen</strong> for a nice GUI, which will let you select each screen's resolution and position. Nothing better for productivity than having your monitors swapped, or even better, flipped upside down.</p>
<p>Well, sometimes "Screen Preferences" won't work either, too bad. In that' case you'll have to get dirty with <strong><a href="www.x.org/wiki/Projects/XRandR">xrandr</a></strong>. It's not too difficult but it's console based (you're not scared of the console, are you?).</p>
<p>Though the man page for xrandr is a little bit intimidating at first you'll just have to do it once, so I won't write about using it, I will just copy &amp; paste a script I keep in my desktop to fix the screen whenever it brakes (my lapop tends to foobar my screen when being docked or undocked, not sure why)</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">xrandr --output HDMI-2 --right-of HDMI-1 --mode 1680x1050 --rotate normal
</pre>
<p>I am sure you can figure out the rest on your own - enjoy the dual screen setup!</p>
