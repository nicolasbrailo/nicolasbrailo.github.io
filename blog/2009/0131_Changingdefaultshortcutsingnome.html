<h1>Changing default shortcuts in gnome<a name="changingdefaultshortcutsingnome"></a></h1>
<p>Another of those thing I usually forget: changing default shortcut actions in gnome. In this case, I'm using
<a href="http://moc.daper.net/">MOC</a> as my music player (see
<a href="/blog/2008/1228_aptgetinstallnewcomputerII.html">apt-get install new computer II</a> and while it's great it won't integrate nicely with gnome. Fortunately (as most GNU/Linux applications do) it can be commanded via CLI so it isn't hard to change this.</p>
<p>Now, gnome keyboard shortcuts already have defined actions, so how can we change them to invoke "a custom command? Easy enough:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open gconf-editor</li>
<li>Go to apps &gt; metacity &gt; keybinding_commands</li>
<li>Set a command from the list. In my case I'm going to set command_1 to "mocp -S", command_2 to "mocp -f" and command_3 to "mocp -r"</li>
<li>Go to"apps &gt; metacity &gt; global_keybinding</li>
<li>Set the corresponding run_command_* to the keyboard shortcut. For me that's 0xA2 for run_command_1, 0xE9 for run_command_2 and 0xEA for run_command_3; beware it changes between keyboards.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Troubleshooting tips:</strong>
* If you use gconf-editor for a key binding don't use it again System &gt; Preferences &gt; Key bindings
* For hex value keybindings (like the ones I used on the example) use uppercase
* If it's not working and you can't figure out why try with an already working command and a simple keybinding (e.g. gnome-screenshot and ctrl-p) then change each one in turn, see where it breaks. Divide and conquer!!</p>
