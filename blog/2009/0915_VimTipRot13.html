<h1>Vim Tip: Rot 13<a name="vimtiprot13"></a></h1>
<p>Are you still puzzled by <a href="/blog/2009/0910_Cincrediblyuselessstuff.html">last week's C++ question</a>, yet you are too lazy to actually search for a Rot13 decoder OR use gcc to check if it works? Well, Vim can do the trick, just use g? to convert text to Rot13</p>
<p>You may combine it with block selection or you can just convert the whole damn thing using "ggg?G". gg goes to the beggining, g? converts to rot13, G goes to the end.</p>
<p>This is all very nice but I'm still trying to figure out a way to convert back from rot13 to normal text, can anyone provide a clue?</p>
