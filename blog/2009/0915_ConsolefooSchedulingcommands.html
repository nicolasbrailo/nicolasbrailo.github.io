<h1>Console foo: Scheduling commands<a name="consolefooschedulingcommands"></a></h1>
<p>You can easily schedule a command using "at", which recognizes a nicely formatted date string.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre lang="bash" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">$ at today 3:00 AM
</pre>
<p>This will open a prompt. So, for example:</p>
<pre lang="bash" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">$ at today 3:30 PM
&gt; wget foobar.com/a_huge_file
&gt; C-D
</pre>
<p>Will schedule a download of a huge file, today at 3:00 AM. Nice, isn't it?
To check the whole list of accepted formats check the man for at.</p>
<p>One last note: at will "remember" the current environment variables, so PWD, USER, OLD_DIR and all that will be the same. This means if you schedule a command with a relative path it'll still work!</p>
