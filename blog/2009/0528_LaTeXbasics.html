<p>Remember <a href="/blog/2009/0521_AcaseforLaTeX.html">last post</a>? I mentioned it&rsquo;s possible to create several type of documents. Even if the structure will, most likely, be different for different applications, there&rsquo;s a common ground which can be used for most LaTeX documents. I&rsquo;d go as far as saying ALL of them, but in LaTeX it&rsquo;s possible to override everything and anything. Any reasonable package won&rsquo;t do it, so let&rsquo;s see some LaTeX basics you can use for any project.</p>
<h3>LaTeX documents<a name="latexdocuments"></a></h3>
<p>The first thing to understand about LaTeX, it&rsquo;s not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a>. If you use a plain text editor you won&rsquo;t see any kind of format at all (LyX provides some sort of preview though). This confuses some people who, used to Word-like applications, tend to think in the structure and desing before the contents; LaTeX is different in the way to structure documents, a way which is called What You See Is What You Mean, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM">WYSIWYM</a>, for short.</p>
<p>What does being WYSIWYM means? You just think about the content and structure and it gets formatted for you. Instead of saying you want &ldquo;Centered, Arial 12px orange font with pink background&rdquo; just say &ldquo;this is a title&rdquo;. The format will be there, but not attached to the content - it&rsquo;ll be in a &ldquo;stylesheet&rdquo;, the document&rsquo;s class (*). Of course, these styles can be changed too.</p>
<p>WYSIWYM has a downside too: you&rsquo;ll have to &ldquo;compile&rdquo; the mark-up text into a pdf (or any other format) using <strong>pdflatex</strong>, for example. It may be a shock to some but it&rsquo;s not difficult, just write &ldquo;<em>pdf2latex file.tex</em>&rdquo; and let it work its magic. You can use the <a href="https://example.net/brokenlink/2009/05/makefile.html">makefile I&rsquo;m attaching</a> to this post too, if you feel comfortable with makefiles (<a href="https://example.net/brokenlink/2009/05/makefile.html">The makefile</a> has a few cool tricks you can use too. I&rsquo;ll explain all of it in another entry).</p>
<h3>Seeing some examples<a name="seeingsomeexamples"></a></h3>
<p>In GNU/Linux you can find lots of examples and templates in /usr/share/doc/texlive-doc/latex/ (no idea where may they be in Windows). Writing this article I found out lots of templates I didn&rsquo;t know about so go and take a look. Go on, I&rsquo;ll wait here. Done? Ok, let&rsquo;s move on.</p>
<h3>Preamble<a name="preamble"></a></h3>
<p>In LaTeX there&rsquo;s a basic structure every document follows:</p>
<pre style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">% Preamble
begin{document}
end{document}
</pre>
<p>What comes before the <em>begin</em>&lsquo;ning is the preamble. There you can tell LaTeX:
* Which packages are you going to use - there are lots of packages, some examples include source code highlighting, including images, absolute positioning of figures and much more. Include them with the usepackage command</p>
<ul>
<li>The style - there are stylesheets you can use, just as you do with HTML, and the preamble is the place to define them. How to do it is package-dependent, Beamer, for example, uses a usetheme tag.</li>
<li>Global declarations - You may declare an image which you&rsquo;ll use throughout the entire document, you&rsquo;re company&rsquo;s logo for example</li>
<li>The author(s) - OK, this is a global declaration too, but there is certain meta-data which is declared in the preamble that&rsquo;s quite handy and author is one of them.</li>
<li>The title - same as before, the title is very important in your document!</li>
<li>Lots more - there are package dependent declarations so there&rsquo;s no way to create a comprehensive list, just remember it&rsquo;s a place to put global settings</li>
</ul>
<p>This post is getting a little bit too large so I&rsquo;ll leave some basic commands for the next one; you should be able to start writing some basic documents anyway.</p>
<p>(*)  Yeah, something like content and style separation but only a couple of decades before it was &ldquo;invented&rdquo; for the WWW.</p>
