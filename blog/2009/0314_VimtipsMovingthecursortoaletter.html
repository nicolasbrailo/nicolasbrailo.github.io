<h1>Vim tips: Moving the cursor to a letter<a name="vimtipsmovingthecursortoaletter"></a></h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, Vim is the best editor in the world, and from now on there&rsquo;ll be a spot in the homepage with a &ldquo;Vim Tip of the Week&rdquo; (check the sidebar).</p>
<p>For the first one a basic tip:
 <strong>Moving to a letter</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>While in command mode press &rsquo;
 <em>f</em>&rsquo; and any other letter; the cursor will move to the first occurence of this letter. This can be combined with other commands and a number of repetitions (e.g. &rsquo;
 <em>d2f.</em>&rsquo;, to delete until the second dot).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a sidenote, I guess there must be a Word Press plugin to display the latest post in a category but I coudn&rsquo;t find it, so I hacked my own: <a href="/blog/2009/0314_TipoftheWeek.html">tip-of-the-week</a></p>
