<h1>Tip of the Week<a name="tipoftheweek"></a></h1>
<p>I recently added a new plugin to display the latest post within a category; there must be another one out there but I coudn't find it, so I hacked my own. I plan to upload it to WP's plugin repository (some day) so I may as well use this post a man page (?)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download the plugin from // TODO</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unzip / untar the file in wp-content/plugins</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable the new plugin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure the category to be searched (in my case I used "Vim Tips") in the settings tab</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the plugin as a widget (or copy&amp;paste the code as needed, it's in the readme)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post something within the new category, if there's nothing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The excerpt from the post and its title will be displayed in the sidebar (or wherever you configured the new plugin)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Easy to use. Hope you like it.</p>
