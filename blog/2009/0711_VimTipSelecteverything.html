<h1>Vim Tip: Select everything<a name="vimtipselecteverything"></a></h1>
<p>There's an easy way to select the whole contents of the document: "ggVG". May seem like a lot at first glance but let's review it part by part:</p>
<ol>
<li>gg: Go to the beggining of the document</li>
<li>V: Enter visual mode</li>
<li>G: Go to the end of the document</li>
</ol>
<p>Easy, isn't it? Now you can press any other command to copy, delete or whatever you like.</p>
