<h1>Welcome!<a name="welcome"></a></h1>
<p>A good friend of mine (a programming junkie just like me) just <a href="http://lsecotaro.blogspot.com/">started his blog</a>, so this is kind of a welcome. Actually there's already a link somewhere in this page so this post is just an excuse to post this recommendation about writing articles for a blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember you didn't like books without pictures as a child? Well, Internet's mental age isn't a day over four years old, use pretty pictures whenever you can.</p>
