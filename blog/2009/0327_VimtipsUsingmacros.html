<h1>Vim tips: Using macros<a name="vimtipsusingmacros"></a></h1>
<p>Clik-click tap, clik-click tap, clik-click tap. A team mate is performing some kind of repetitive operation with text and it&rsquo;s becoming more and more annoying. Good news, there&rsquo;s a way to keep your mental sanity and help this guy to be more productive: replace him with a sed/awk script teach him how to use Vim macros!</p>
<p>Vim macros can repeat for you a sequence of commands. Press <strong><em>q</em></strong><strong><em>q</em></strong> to start recording, then&rdquo;<strong><em>q</em></strong> again to stop. Use <strong><em>@q</em></strong> to execute a macro. Let&rsquo;s try it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This - random garbage
is - random garbage
a - random garbage
sample - random garbage
text - random garbage</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, how would you get rid of the random garbage? Move the cursor to the beggining of the first line, press <strong><em>qq</em></strong> to start recording then <strong><em>f-</em></strong> to move the cursor to the dash and <strong><em>d$</em></strong> to delete the rest of the line. Now move the cursor to the begging of the next line (<strong><em>0j</em></strong>) and press <strong><em>q</em></strong> to stop recording. Now press <strong><em>4@q</em></strong> to repeat the macro for times and check the results; you should have something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This
is
a
sample
text</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neat, huh? You can also store any number of macros using a different letter after the <strong><em>q</em></strong> to start recording, for example <strong><em>qn</em></strong> to record and <strong><em>@n</em></strong> to execute. Also, use <strong><em>@@</em></strong> to execute once again the last executed macro (from any buffer).</p>
<p>There are some more things you can do with macros (like editing before executing one) but the best source for that is the manual.</p>
