<p>Can't believe it... <strong>a whole year has gone by</strong> and I didn't even notice. The <a href="/blog/2008/1009_self.start.html">frist psot</a> was over a year ago and now with over a hundred posts in the archives, a <a href="/blog/youfoundadeadlink.html">second blog</a> [spanish only] starting, many changes in the directions of the articles and a timidly and ever quiet growing reader base, I can say I didn't learn anything at all from the experience.</p>
<p>I bet that's not the kind of speech you were expecting but the message I would like to transmit today is this: to all the people trying to start a blog, do it for fun, nothing more nothing less. Don't expect any kind of epiphany (not even in a web browser form) nor a sudden burst in online popularity (what for anyway?). You may get those as a byproduct of the experience but starting a blog only for that is a recipe for boredom and frustration.</p>
<p><strong>Write, for a whole year, just because it's fun</strong></p>
