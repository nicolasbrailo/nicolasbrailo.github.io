<h1>Zomg! happy (late) birthday<a name="zomghappylatebirthday"></a></h1>
<p>Can&rsquo;t believe it&hellip; <strong>a whole year has gone by</strong> and I didn&rsquo;t even notice. The <a href="blog_md/2008/1009_self.start.md">frist psot</a> was over a year ago and now with over a hundred posts in the archives, a <a href="/blog/youfoundadeadlink.html">second blog</a> [spanish only] starting, many changes in the directions of the articles and a timidly and ever quiet growing reader base, I can say I didn&rsquo;t learn anything at all from the experience.</p>
<p>I bet that&rsquo;s not the kind of speech you were expecting but the message I would like to transmit today is this: to all the people trying to start a blog, do it for fun, nothing more nothing less. Don&rsquo;t expect any kind of epiphany (not even in a web browser form) nor a sudden burst in online popularity (what for anyway?). You may get those as a byproduct of the experience but starting a blog only for that is a recipe for boredom and frustration.</p>
<p><strong>Write, for a whole year, just because it&rsquo;s fun</strong></p>
