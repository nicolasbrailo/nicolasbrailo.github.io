<h1>Grumpy Old Man: What I Hate About SQL<a name="grumpyoldmanwhatihateaboutsql"></a></h1>
<p>SQL is ugly by itself, it may rightfuly be considered so by its pseudo standarization, the ugly syntax and many other things which don&rsquo;t matter here, but there&rsquo;s something really really stupid, one bit of its syntax which drives me crazy.</p>
<p>Why, why oh why, doesn&rsquo;t the standard allows &ldquo;SELECT Foo, FROM
TABLE&rdquo; to be valid syntax? I always forget to remove the last comma when
 there are lots of fields and don&rsquo;t tell me you don&rsquo;t, I know that is a
lie!</p>
