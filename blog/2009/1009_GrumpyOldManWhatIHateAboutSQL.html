<h1>Grumpy Old Man: What I Hate About SQL<a name="grumpyoldmanwhatihateaboutsql"></a></h1>
<p>SQL is ugly by itself, it may rightfuly be considered so by its pseudo standarization, the ugly syntax and many other things which don't matter here, but there's something really really stupid, one bit of its syntax which drives me crazy.</p>
<p>Why, why oh why, doesn't the standard allows "SELECT Foo, FROM
TABLE" to be valid syntax? I always forget to remove the last comma when
 there are lots of fields and don't tell me you don't, I know that is a
lie!</p>
