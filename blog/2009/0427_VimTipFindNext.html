<h1>Vim Tip: Find Next<a name="vimtipfindnext"></a></h1>
<p>In normal mode, move the cursor to any word. How do you search for the next occurrence of that word?</p>
<p>Press the * key to search forwards for the current word, or press # to search backwards.</p>
<p>Using * or # searches for the exact word at the cursor (searching for rain would not find rainbow).</p>
<p>Use g* or g# if you don&rsquo;t want to search for the exact word.</p>
