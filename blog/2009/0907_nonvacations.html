<h1>non-vacations<a name="nonvacations"></a></h1>
<p>After some sick time, lots of work, prepearing my new blog (monosinfinitos.com.ar, go check it) and several other,personal stuff regular blog updates will resume tomorrow and continue at least for a week. That's about the buffer size I've left, after that I'll have to write something new or take a longer vacation... we'll see.</p>
<p>In the meantime, enjoy a pretty picture. [BROKENLINK]</p>
