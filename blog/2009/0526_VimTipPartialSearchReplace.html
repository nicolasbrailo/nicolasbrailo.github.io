<h1>Vim Tip: Partial Search &amp; Replace<a name="vimtippartialsearchreplace"></a></h1>
<p>So, you have a paragraph, or any kind of text, and need to replace a substring without altering other paragraphs. You could write :set number and then :A,Bs/what to search/what to replace/g, being A and B the start and end of the paragraph, or you could just use <a href="/blog/2009/0507_VimTipVisualMode.html">visual mode</a>.</p>
<p>Enter line selection mode (Shift + V) and then select a block of text. Without moving the cursor any further type :s/SEARCH/REPLACE and the search string in the selected block will be replaced without altering any other part of the document.</p>
