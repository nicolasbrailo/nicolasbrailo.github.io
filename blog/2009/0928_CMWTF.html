Long version: The other day, while stranded on a CLI (using ssh) I did a wget $IP, to see a modem's status web page. I'd have thought an electronic device (which, obviously, is much more difficult to upgrade than a software product, and that's difficult enough as it is) is a little bit better tested than that. I should have known better by now.
