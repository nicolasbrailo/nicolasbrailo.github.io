<div class="post">
<p>Some time ago I saw a discussion at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletest/">google test</a> mailing list which made me ask myself how would I go about implementing TDD for a legacy codebase project, based from previous experiences. I came up with a list, open to discussion, which may be useful as a guideline for someone in this situation.</p>
<h3>Start with integration tests<a name="startwithintegrationtests"></a></h3>
<p>Integration tests are ugly and won't give you a lot of information about what went wrong when something does, but you have no chance of running real unit tests in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">non-injectable</a> code.</p>
<p>Use the integration tests as a safenet to refactor the critical methods, those which will be changed the most during the projects lifetime, which leads me to the next point;</p>
<h3>Test as you refactor (or implement new functionality)<a name="testasyourefactororimplementnewfunctionality"></a></h3>
<p>If you plan to stop the business and write a kabillion tests for your legacy codebase you're out of luck. Not only you'll fail because the lack of value but you'll spend weeks writing tests and never see the ROI - you'll quickly grow tired.</p>
<p>With integration tests in place take your time to write real unit tests as needed, that is when you implement new functionality or when you plan to refactor something - which should be to implement new functionality or to fix a bug.</p>
<h3>KISS<a name="kiss"></a></h3>
<p>Can't stress this enough: keep your tests simple. You'll notice you end up with 80% boilerplate code, setting up mocks, creating test objects, etc. When that test fails you'll have no clue why was it there in the first place.</p>
<p>This happens a lot with legacy codebases, where stagnant code tends to get quite coupled and messy. If you plan to write a big mega test to cover every use case with a single test, the day it fail you'll quickly know it's not production ready but you'll have no clue why is that.</p>
<h3>Mock layers<a name="mocklayers"></a></h3>
<p>If you have a project divided in components (even the ugliest legacy code tends have some sort of layers separation, even if coupled with other components) try to create mocks for a whole layer of the application (I ended up with a complete mock of a DB, for example). This will help you in the long run to isolate troublesome modules.</p>
<h3>Have a team commitment<a name="haveateamcommitment"></a></h3>
<p>If you're working on your own or with a team, make it mandatory to run the tests for each commit. Even better if you can implement a continuous integration server.</p>
