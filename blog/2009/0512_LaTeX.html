<h1>LaTeX!<a name="latex"></a></h1>
<p>Some time ago I wrote a review about <a href="http://debaday.debian.net/2008/01/20/lyx-a-text-editor-that-stays-out-of-the-way/">LyX</a> for <a href="http://debaday.debian.net">DPOTD (recommended link)</a> and now I think it's time for an update: what can you do when LyX is not enough?</p>
<p>I'll quote myself; the original article ends (almost) like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What LyX isn’t for</strong></p>
<p>Although LyX may be a valuable piece in anyone toolkit it’s worth noticing it isn’t exactly the Swiss army knife of the text editors. If you need to define a very customized layout or format, like slides for a presentation, this is the wrong tool for the job.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After having prepared several presentations with LyX (even my CV!) I'd like to write some more on this last part. Even if I thought that my original comment was mistaken I write once again the same: when you have to create a presentation LyX is not the tool for the job, LaTeX is.</p>
<p>As I explained in that article, LyX is a front-end for LaTeX but at the same time it's only a small part of LaTeX. Doing several presentations in LyX (using Beamer, a package I'll talk about in another post) I noticed that most of my documents where "ERT", evil red text, which is nothing else than plain TeX code: that means, each time more, I was using LaTeX functionality not available from LyX. This is the reason I've decided to write a how-to LaTeX, a small survival guide for those want to start using with the tips and tricks I've learned in this time.</p>
<p>The target for these posts series will be, mainly, programmers or other advanced users, without fear of working a little bit in the console, markup languages and maybe a makefile.</p>
<p>Soon the first part :)</p>
