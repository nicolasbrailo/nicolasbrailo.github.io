<h1>Vim Tip: Using markers<a name="vimtipusingmarkers"></a></h1>
<p>Set a marker if you whish Vim to remember a cursor position Use m* to mark current position (use a to z for position names) and then '* to move to mark * (again, a to z).</p>
<p>This trick can be very useful when editing a large file (or lots of files) in case you need to quickly edit something and then return to the previous spot.</p>
