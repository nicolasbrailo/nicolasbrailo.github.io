<h1>gdb: graphic (tui) mode<a name="gdbgraphictuimode"></a></h1>
<p>A little known fact about gdb is that you can use it in graphics mode, called TUI. Yes, you can obviously use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/">DDD</a> or a similar front end but that's not even nearly as cool as using a console based GUI (!), is it?</p>
<p>The easiest way is to start gdb like this:</p>
<pre style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">gdb -tui
</pre>
<p>That will display the usual gdb console plus a code listing, similar to the code listing you get using the "list" command but shown in another window. Alternatively you can press C-X C-A (both, in that order) while in gdb to switch between TUI mode and back.</p>
