<h1>Vim Tip: Easy Indent<a name="vimtipeasyindent"></a></h1>
<p>Editing source code means you'll be doing a lot of indenting and reindenting. There's an easy way to indent or de-indent a block, using just "&lt;" and "&gt;".</p>
<p>Using "&gt;" without anyother command will indent that line by itself; use <a href="/blog/2009/0507_VimTipVisualMode.html">visual mode</a> (Shift + V) to select several lines and indent them in one keystroke. You could also press "v%&gt;" while sitting at the beggining of a block to indent it. The same applies to "&lt;".</p>
