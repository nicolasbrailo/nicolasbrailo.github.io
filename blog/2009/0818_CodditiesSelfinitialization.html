<h1>C++ oddities: Self initialization<a name="codditiesselfinitialization"></a></h1>
<p>I get it, C++ is a complex language, but man, I&rsquo;d like a little warning (lol) when this happens:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">class Foo {
  int bar;
  Foo() : bar(bar) {}
};
</pre>
<p>Yeah, it bit me in the ass the other day. Why? A method&rsquo;s signature was awfully long, I wanted to delete a parameter and ended up deleting two. Luckly my <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googletest/">unit tests</a> where there to save the day, but regardless, WTF?</p>
