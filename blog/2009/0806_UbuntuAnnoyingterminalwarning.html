<h1>Ubuntu: Annoying terminal warning<a name="ubuntuannoyingterminalwarning"></a></h1>
<p>Although I'm quite happy with Ubuntu 9.04, I find a couple of new features quite annoying. The warning message it pops up whenever you try to close a console with a running program in it falls in this category. Fortunately it's not difficult to disable:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open up gconf-editor</li>
<li>goto /apps/gnome-terminal/global/</li>
<li>Untick confirm_window_close</li>
</ol>
<p>All set. As a bonus side effect now closing a terminal with multiple tabs won't pop up a message either.</p>
