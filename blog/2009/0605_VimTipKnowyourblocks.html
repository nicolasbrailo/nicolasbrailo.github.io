<h1>Vim Tip: Know your blocks!<a name="vimtipknowyourblocks"></a></h1>
<p>Vim is the best editor for programmers and as such it has some neat "programmer commands", which make editing source code a lot easier. Take for example a block with code, or a function definition: how many times did you have to copy the code between parenthesis from one place to the other?</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">int foo(int bar, int baz)
</pre>
<p>You could do '0f(df)' to delete "int bar, int baz" but that won't do if the definition is more complicated than that. 'dib' is a better choice to delete the text.</p>
<p>(ACTION)i{b|B} applies ACTION to a block, for example, pressing diB in</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">void foo() _ {
    /<em> Lots of source code </em>/
}
</pre>
<p>(with the cursor placed at _) will delete lots of source code.</p>
