<h1>LaTeX: including documents<a name="latexincludingdocuments"></a></h1>
<p>This is a post from my LaTeX series - <a href="/search/label/LaTeX">check the others too</a>!</p>
<p>So far we've seen some of LaTeX advantages, and a few basic commands to get you started. Let's see a trick to be more proficient with it:</p>
<h3>Including other tex files<a name="includingothertexfiles"></a></h3>
<p>You should be able to write some simple documents now, some in LyX, some in LaTeX, but you'll soon start to notice that using a single text file to create a large document becomes cumbersome. Even more so if you need to split the work between several people in a team.</p>
<p>There's an easy way to keep a main file and then several, smaller, files in which you can work more comfortably:</p>
<pre><code>include{file.tex}
</code></pre>
<p>Easy, right?</p>
<p>Beware, you can't use an include inside an include. Why? No idea, but there's a way around this:</p>
<pre><code>input{file.tex}
</code></pre>
<h3>Quick preview<a name="quickpreview"></a></h3>
<p>Using includes has another advantage: you can have a quick preview while working with a chapter at a time. I usually keep the following structure within my projects:</p>
<pre><code>% Header declarations
% Include packages
% Document preamble
% ...
%input{chapter1.tex}
%input{chapter2.tex}
input{chapter3.tex}
% input{chapter4.tex}
</code></pre>
<p>Just uncomment the chapter you're working with. In big documents this has a very noticeable effect, as compiling a large LaTeX file into an enormous pdf document (several MBs) may be quite slow.</p>
<p>Of course, I use "input" in my main file so I can use include in the chapters themselves. I won't usually need to include other documents inside the chapters, it'd get quite messy, but it's necessary to work with embedded documents, as we'll see in another post.</p>
