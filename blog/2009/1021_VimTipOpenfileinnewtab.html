<h1>Vim Tip: Open file in new tab<a name="vimtipopenfileinnewtab"></a></h1>
<p>How many times have you been on a project which #includes another file and wanted to see what that file was? Well you can navigate the source code tree in a gui if you use eclipse. You can go to File &gt; Open and, again, fight with a nice gui in Notepad. Or you can open up that file with four keystrokes in a real editor, THE real editor. Just use &ldquo;C-W g f&rdquo; with the cursor over the filename and it&rsquo;ll open in a new tab, ready for you to hack away more code.</p>
