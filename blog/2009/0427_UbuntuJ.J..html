<h2>Ubuntu J.J.</h2>

Post by Nico Brailovsky @ 2009-04-27 - <a href="/blog/2009/0427_UbuntuJ.J..html">Permalink</a> 

<p>I've been using <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu 8.10</a> for couple of months and soon began to think about switching to <a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a> or some other - more stable - distro. At work Ubuntu 8.10 seemd too unstable, with frequent crashes and slow. Instead of switching I decided to upgrade to 9.04 soon after its release, something I've always avoided (best to wait for a couple of months, until it gets more stable. Even better if it is an LTS). So far I must say this is the best Ubuntu relase I've seen.</p>
<p>Some highlights after the first couple of days:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The install was flawless and quick. In fact I didn't even see it install, just left it running and went to another PC to install 8.04 (I was at <a href="/blog/2009/0416_FLISOL.html">FLISOL</a>) and came back to a fully functioning system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configuring my dual monitor setup at the office required some work but not more than 8.04 and 8.10.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm still a little uncomfortable with the notification system but it's not worse than before (though I'm not sure if it's better).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still having some problems with SCIM on Opera, not sure who's at fault there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The boot times are FAST. In fact the whole thing seems fast and stable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The graphics handling are improved. Compiz works much better, I can even run it with my dual monitr setup (something I couldn't do with 8.10).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, a great release and a must upgrade for sure. Ubuntu FTW!</p>
