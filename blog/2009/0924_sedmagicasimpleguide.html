<h1>sed magic: a simple guide<a name="sedmagicasimpleguide"></a></h1>
<p>The other day I had to create one of those "enum to string" functions. They really suck, always getting out of sync, so I made a script to auto-update the header file containing this function... just add a target to the makefile and you're done!</p>
<p>Anyway, this is the part of the script I came up with to get the enum elements:</p>
<pre lang="bash" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">
cat enum_definition.h | sed -n &#x27;/enum OID/,/};/ s/(.*)/1/p&#x27;
</pre>
<p>Nice voodoo, isn't it? How the hell are you supposed to understand that? Well, you're not, sed is write-only-code, but you can try reading <a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html#toc-uh-25">http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html#toc-uh-25</a>, a great sed introduction.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>
