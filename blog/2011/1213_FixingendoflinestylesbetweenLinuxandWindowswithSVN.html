<h1>Fixing end of line styles between Linux and Windows with SVN<a name="fixingendoflinestylesbetweenlinuxandwindowswithsvn"></a></h1>
<p>Quite a mouthful for such an easy thing. Don't you just hate when half the people in a project use CR/LF and the other half just LF?</p>
<p>Luckly this is easy to fix, assuming you are using svn. You can use something called <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Subversion/auto-props">auto-props</a> to setup the eol style for different file types.</p>
<p>Set it once for the project, never worry again. Anyone knows its git counterpart?</p>
