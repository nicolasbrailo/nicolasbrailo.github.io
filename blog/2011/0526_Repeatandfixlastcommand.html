<h1>Repeat (and fix) last command<a name="repeatandfixlastcommand"></a></h1>
<p>How many times have you run a command but forgot to add sudo at the beginning? How many times did you open vim instead of gvim? All that has an easy fix, instead of pressing up-left-left-left-left-left... (almost like a Konami code, isn't it?) just use <code>!!</code>.</p>
<p><code>!!</code> expands to the previous command, so for example:</p>
<pre style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">vim foo
</pre>
<p>, then</p>
<pre style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">g!!
</pre>
<p>will execute "gvim foo".</p>
<p>Another common problem, you mistype vim for vmi (hey, it may be a common problem if you're dyslexic). Just type fc, short for fix command, to open the last command in your configured editor. Fix it (lxp, bonus points if anyone understand this :D) then write and save. The fixed command will be executed.</p>
