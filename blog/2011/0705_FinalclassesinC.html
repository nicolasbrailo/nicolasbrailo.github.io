<h1>Final classes in C++<a name="finalclassesinc"></a></h1>
<p>Have you ever wondered what&rsquo;s the best way of having a class from which you can&rsquo;t inherit, say, like Java&rsquo;s final? Without any doubt, the best way is having a team capable of not doing things like inheriting from &lsquo;class NeverEverEverInheritFromThis&rsquo;. The second best way involves some magic and lots of beer:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">class Final {
    protected:
    Final() {}
};
</pre>
<p>So, what the hell does that evil device do? Easy, it defines a protected constructor, meaning only derived classes will be able to access it (i.e. no public construction of this object). How does this stop other classes from inheriting? It doesn&rsquo;t, unless we add one more keyword:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">class Final {
    protected:
    Final() {}
};
class X : virtual Final {
};
</pre>
<p>The virtual inheritance is meant to be used to avoid the dreaded diamond in multiple inheritance designs. It does a lot of magic with the constructors and the memory layout of the object; amongst other things, it&rsquo;ll make any class which derives from X have only a single base class for Final and it&rsquo;ll also make this hypothetical class call Final&rsquo;s constructor without going through X first.</p>
<p>A complete explanation of virtual inheritance is beyond the scope of this article, but it&rsquo;s enough for our Final device to know that it forces the virtual base&rsquo;s constructors to be called first, thus now we can write this:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">class Final {
    protected:
    Final() {}
};
class X : virtual Final {
};
class Y : public X {
};
int main() {
    X x;
    Y y;
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>Try it and watch it fail!</p>
<p><strong>Update 2011-07-08:</strong> Amazing how time flies. This article has been written about a year before its publishing, and, believe it or not, it&rsquo;s already showing its age. What I would update on this article is the first paragraph: the best way of not having a problem with final classes is creating a design which doesn&rsquo;t have artificial restrictions to the growth and extensibility of the system (i.e: don&rsquo;t use final classes, they are usually a bad idea). I like that idea, I may write another article about it.</p>
