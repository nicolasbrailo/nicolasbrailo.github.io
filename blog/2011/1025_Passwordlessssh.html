<h1>Passwordless ssh<a name="passwordlessssh"></a></h1>
<p>This is one of those things that are terribly easy nowadays, but since I only do it every once in a while I never remember how it's done: setting up a passwordless ssh. I won't write any explanation, just the command to set it up so I can keep it as reference for the next time I have to do it:</p>
<pre lang="bash"><code lang="bash">ssh-keygen -t rsa &amp;&amp; ssh-copy-id USR@HOST
</code></pre>
<p>You might also want to specify that HOST requires USR, instead of $(whoami), so you won't have to type ssh USR@HOST next time you want a passwordless loggin. This can be done in /etc/ssh/ssh_config, like this:</p>
<pre lang="bash"><code lang="bash">
Host $HOST
    User $USER
</code></pre>
<p>Replace as needed.</p>
