<h1>Vim Tip: Vigor<a name="vimtipvigor"></a></h1>
<p>Oh man. Just do a search on google images for Vim + Vigor. There are so many WTF images to choose from, I just can&rsquo;t decide. Apparently since Vim is the name of sexual enhancement drug or something like that, combining Vim and Vigor is a formula for fun.</p>
<p>Well, Vim and Vigor have a different meaning in Linux. Just do an apt-get install vigor, then run it. You&rsquo;ll have lots of fun with Vim&rsquo;s evil cousing, I promise.</p>
