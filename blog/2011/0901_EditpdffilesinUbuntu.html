<h1>Edit pdf files in Ubuntu<a name="editpdffilesinubuntu"></a></h1>
<p>Well, for some reason my LaTeX py-pygments stopped compiling. Thanks for breaking backwards compatibility, you pig-ments.</p>
<p>I had two options, either spend hours trying to fix this by altering the preamble, or just edit the pdf file. Yeah, I know, editing the pdf sounds ugly as hell, but hey at 2 am in the morning I&rsquo;ll take anything. And pdfedit was there to save the day (night). Just apt-get install pdfedit, it&rsquo;s in the repo.</p>
