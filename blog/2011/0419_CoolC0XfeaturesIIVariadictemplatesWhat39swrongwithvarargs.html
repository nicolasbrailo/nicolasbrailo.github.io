<h1>Cool C++0X features II, Variadic templates: What&#39;s wrong with varargs<a name="coolc0xfeaturesiivariadictemplateswhat39swrongwithvarargs"></a></h1>
<p><a href="/blog/2011/0418_CoolC0XfeaturesIIntro.html">Last time</a> we explained what variadic templates are. We'll see what they can do now. We mentioned that solving the problem of having a type-safe varargs is one of the best ways of applying variadic templates, but what's varargs?</p>
<p>Varargs functions (from C world, not even from C++!) are functions which have a variable number of arguments, just like printf. These are usually very dangerous functions, since they are not typesafe. Let's see how they are implemented with an example:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
// My god, it&#x27;s full of bugs
void va_println(int args_left, ...) {
   va_list arg_lst;
   va_start(arg_lst, args_left);
   while(args_left--) {
      const char <em>p = va_arg(arg_lst, const char</em>);
      std::cout &lt;&lt; p;
   }
   va_end(arg_lst);
}
int main() {
   va_println(3, &quot;Hola &quot;, &quot;mundo&quot;, &quot;n&quot;);
   return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>This implementation of a function with variable arguments is, more or less, the best C can give us, yet it riddled with bugs and hidden problems. Let's go one by one:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arg num will get out of sync</strong>: You need to specify the list of args as well as how many you have. That WILL get out of sync. Trust me, it's just a mater of time. And when it does, you'll have a coredump.</li>
<li><strong>Type-unsafe</strong>: You just tell varargs "Hey, get me an int". And it will give you an int, no warranties included. If it was supposed to be a short instead, though luck, you end up with a coredump.</li>
<li><strong>No, really, coredump</strong>: Where are so many coredumps coming from, you may ask. Easy, varargs it's just a way of handling the stack. Calling va_arg just moves the stack pointer by the sizeof the datatype you requested. That means no compile-time checks are included.</li>
<li><strong>No pod types</strong>: Remember POD types? Try running this code:</li>
</ul>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;
struct X { virtual ~X(){} };
void va_println(int args_left, ...) {
   va_list arg_lst;
   va_start(arg_lst, args_left);
   while(args_left--) {
      X <em>p = va_arg(arg_lst, X</em>);
   }
   va_end(arg_lst);
}
int main() {
   X x, y, z;
   va_println(3, x, y, z);
   return 0;
}
</pre>
<h3>And how do we fix it?<a name="andhowdowefixit"></a></h3>
<p>The fix is easy. Too easy. You just need C++0X. We will discuss why this is better next time, but just as a sneak peak:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">void println() {}
template &lt;typename H, typename... T&gt; void println(H p, T... t) {
   std::cout &lt;&lt; p;
   println(t...);
}
int main() {
   println(&quot;Hola&quot;, &quot; mundo &quot;, 42, &#x27;n&#x27;);
   return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>Remember to compile using -std=c++0x in gcc.</p>

<p>"Type-unsafe: You just tell varargs &ldquo;Hey, get me an int&rdquo;. And it will give you an int, no warranties included. If it was supposed to be a short instead, though luck, you end up with a coredump."</p>
<p>While the concept is true in general, your exact example is not exactly right. Variadic functions perform integral promotion on all of the arguments. So if you pass a short you have to read it back out using va_arg(vl, int).</p>
<p>If however you pass a short and then do va_arg(vl, short), you could be triggering undefined behavior.. Similarly with char and the unsigned variants which all get promoted to int.</p>
<p>More reasons not to use variadic functions...</p>
