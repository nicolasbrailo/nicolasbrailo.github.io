<h1>200th post!<a name="200thpost"></a></h1>
<p>Yes, this is the post number 200 on this blog. Considering we are a month away of starting the fourth year, I guess that gives me quite a lousy periodicity, but I am still surprised I post somewhat regularly here after such a long time (hey, in programmer years that&rsquo;s like a whole life!).</p>
<p>Since the beginning this blog has mutated from being &nbsp;my public notepad to being a place where I research new topics, or write about things that are generally interesting to me. I lost many readers for posting crazy metaprogramming stuff and for constantly babbling about Vim and Linux, but hey, I&rsquo;m proud of if. Let&rsquo;s see what the next 200 posts bring here.</p>
