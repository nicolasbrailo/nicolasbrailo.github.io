<h1>Anonymous objects in C++<a name="anonymousobjectsinc"></a></h1>
<p>There are not many cases in which you can have an anonymous *anything* in your code, yet there's an idiom in C++ which lets you use an object with an anonymous type. Like this:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">void foo()
{
   struct {
      int x;
   };
}
</pre>
<p>Why would this be useful, you may ask. That's a valid question. This idiom can be very useful to write callbacks, like this:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">struct Interface {
   void callback() = 0;
};
void bar(Interface &amp;amp;c);
void foo()
{
   struct : public Interface {
      /<em> ... </em>/
   } x;
   bar(x);
}
</pre>
<p>I am not aware of many other uses for an anonymous type. Even more considering this idiom can now be replaced with a much cleaner lambda. But hey, it looks cool!</p>

<p>An anonymous object
An anonymous object is essentially a value that has no name.
Because they have no name, there's no way to refer to them beyond the point where they are created. Consequently, they have &ldquo;expression scope&rdquo;, meaning they are created, evaluated, and destroyed all within a single expression.
Here's an add() function written using an anonymous object:</p>
<pre style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">#include
int add(int x, int y)
{
 return x + y; // an anonymous object is created to hold and return the result of x + y
}
int main()
{
 std::cout &lt;&lt; add(5, 3);
return 0;
}
</pre>
