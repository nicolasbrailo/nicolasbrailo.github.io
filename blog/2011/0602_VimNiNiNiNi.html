<p>Even though I have vim a Vim fan for a long time there still is a lot of stuff which amazes me about this little editor, and this thing I last learned about it is in the "ZOMG that's so cool I'm about to pee my pants" category. Unfortunately, if I were to draw a Venn diagram of the people who may find it cool I'd have to intersect the group of people reading my blog (yes, very small) with the group of people who like Vim and Monty Python. So, here's to the null group:</p>
<p>Type <strong>:Ni!</strong> in Vim and be amazed, it'll reply back: <strong>Do you demand a shrubbery?</strong></p>
