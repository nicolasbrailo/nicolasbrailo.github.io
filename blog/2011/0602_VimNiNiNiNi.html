<h1>Vim: Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!<a name="vimnininini"></a></h1>
<p>Even though I have vim a Vim fan for a long time there still is a lot of stuff which amazes me about this little editor, and this thing I last learned about it is in the &ldquo;ZOMG that&rsquo;s so cool I&rsquo;m about to pee my pants&rdquo; category. Unfortunately, if I were to draw a Venn diagram of the people who may find it cool I&rsquo;d have to intersect the group of people reading my blog (yes, very small) with the group of people who like Vim and Monty Python. So, here&rsquo;s to the null group:</p>
<p>Type <strong>:Ni!</strong> in Vim and be amazed, it&rsquo;ll reply back: <strong>Do you demand a shrubbery?</strong></p>
