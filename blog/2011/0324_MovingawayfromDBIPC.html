<h1>Moving away from DB IPC<a name="movingawayfromdbipc"></a></h1>
<p><a href="/blog/2011/0322_DBIPCCommunicatingprocessesthewrongway.html">Last time</a> I wrote about why DB IPC is bad. Now I intend to write about the way to start moving away from it, towards a better architecture.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, this pattern is deeply rooted across all the enterprise platform, so removing it is not an easy task, and it can only be done in small steps. Small steps means a compromise solution, you won&rsquo;t be going from IPC DB to a restful application in a week, so having an ugly-but-not-so-much-as-ipc-db solution is the way to go.</p>
<p>The first step to move from DB IPC to a services oriented architecture is moving from data driven applications to event driven applications. That means, instead of polling the database for changes, receive a notification that the data has changed and act upon the event.</p>
<p>A way to implement notifications without polling is having the DB notify you of any changes occurred. A way of doing this is using something like otl_subscriber, a wrapper to Oracle&rsquo;s notifications features. Postgres has its own notification schema, MySQL AFAIK doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Once you have managed to separate the responsibility of processing the event and the data of the event itself, it&rsquo;s easy to go one step beyond and implement a messaging platform, like CORBA or something like AMQP.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: the architecture may not be nice with DB notifications either, but you have taken the first step towards decoupling two different components. From this schema to a real queue there&rsquo;s only one step, and once there you can finally begin to have a db-schema for each application.</p>
