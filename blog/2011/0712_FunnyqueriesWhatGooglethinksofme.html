<h1>Funny queries: What Google thinks of me<a name="funnyquerieswhatgooglethinksofme"></a></h1>
<p>It's been a long time since I used the metapost category. I've been taking a look at the queries received by Google for which this blogs shows up. Some of them are quite peculiar, some of them may give us an insight of what the search engine things of me. For example:</p>
<pre><code>|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Query | Impressions |
| grumpy old man | 2,000 |
| grumpy | 400 |
| grumpy man | 400 |
| ugly old man | 250 |
| grouchy old man | 110 |
| grumpy old | 35 |
| old grumpy man | 70 |
| grumpy gnome | 12 |
</code></pre>
<p>There was a long list of variations to these phrases, but I didn't want such a long post. Anyway, if you thought that grumpy is all Google considers me to be, brace yourself for a surprise:</p>
<pre><code>|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Query | Impressions |
| trained monkey | 90 |
| no life | 90 |
| funny troll |  |
| monkey using computer |  |
| tool monkey |  |
| congratulations monkey |  |
| monkey using tools |  |
</code></pre>
<p>Basically, a computer using trained-troll monkey, with no life. Pretty accurate, some people may say.</p>
<pre><code>|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Query | Impressions |
| se&ntilde;al de muerte | 12 |
</code></pre>
<p>Literally signal of death in Spanish. Tip: Lack of pulse.</p>
<p>Another common search:</p>
<pre><code>|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| hang yourself | 200 |
| how to hang yourself | 90 |
| rope to hang yourself | 12 |
</code></pre>
<p>I guess those searches have a very low returning rate.</p>
<p>This is a query which sincerely surprised me:</p>
<pre><code>|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Query | Impressions |
| eliphant |  |
| eiephant |  |
| elehant |  |
| elepant |  |
| eephant |  |
| elephanth |  |
</code></pre>
<p>I'll do a public service here: it's written 'elephant', buddy.</p>
