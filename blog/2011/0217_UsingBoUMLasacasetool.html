<h1>Using BoUML as a case tool<a name="usingboumlasacasetool"></a></h1>
<p>I don't really fancy CASE tools a lot, they are mostly fads, but I must admit it, using BoUML to work on a design the other day was a nice surprise. Not only the generated code didn't seem to be written by an trained monkey [1], it almost seemed to be usable with some tweaking. It even generated nice javadocs!</p>
<p>For this article I'll asume you have some experience with <a href="https://www.bouml.fr/">BoUML</a>. If you don't, apt-get it (it's available for Linux and Windows) then come back later, I'll wait.
<a href="https://www.bouml.fr/documentation.html">BoUML's manual</a> is quite good and includes a lot of screenshots, but if you're already experienced using it you may find this short checklist quicker to create a new project and use the code generation tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Languages &gt; C++ [...]; this will tell BoUML what language should generate. I haven't tried other than C++ but I've heard they work fine.</li>
<li>Draw some nice UML to create a couple of classes (i.e. create a class view and a class diagram, then add some classes). Don't forget to add some relationships, so the generated code can be something more than "class Foobar{};"</li>
<li>Create a deployment view. Something like "Foobar_deploy"</li>
<li>Edit the class view, it should open a class view dialog. Select your new deployment view</li>
<li>Right click on each class and click "Create source artifact". This'll create a new artifact under your deployment view</li>
<li>Almost done. In project &gt; Edit &gt; Edit Generation Settings go to "Directory" tab and select a root directory</li>
<li>You're now ready to right click on your class view and select "Generate &gt; C++". Congratulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generating namespaces in C++ wasn't easy at first, and the manual may not be so clear about this one:
* Create a package. Move everything there (your deployment view, class view, etc).
* Edit the package. Under C++ complete each path and namespace name (?). For example, Foo, Foo Foo would generate your sources and headers under ./Foo, with namespace Foo.
* Repeat for as many namespaces as you want. You can have nested namespaces but you'll have to specify the full path and namespace name, i.e. Foo/Bar, Foo/Bar_CPP, Foo::Bar</p>
<p>If you're going to use BoUML as a case tool, you'll want to name associations, use the multiplicity, create setters and getters and all the stuff you probably never did when documenting in UML to reach a <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Very,_Very_Well_Documented.aspx">minimum user-documentation wheight</a>. It seems these CASE tools haven't developed telepathy yet. Too bad.</p>

[1] Regardless of the fact that some may say that about my own code.</p>
