<h1>I thought we had deprecated regedit<a name="ithoughtwehaddeprecatedregedit"></a></h1>
<p>By Nico Brailovsky @ 2011-02-22</p>
<p>Guys, I thought we had already agreed on this <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/08/was-the-windows-registry-a-good-idea.html">a long time ago</a>. Windows registry sucks. It&rsquo;s a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>Why TF is <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreNautilusLocationBar">regedit</a> still used in Gnome? I&rsquo;d switch to KDE, if only I wasn&rsquo;t so lazy.</p>

<p>NotReally, it&rsquo;s just a helper tool to avoid editing xml files.</p>

<p>Agreeing with NotReally, all gconf-editor is, is a user friendly wrapper for GNOME and surrounding graphical environment. Redegit is not even close to the same thing as it retains core system and subsystem values and variables. Everything in the Windows environment relies on the registry. With a GTK enabled environment, this is never the case.</p>

<h1>Using BoUML as a case tool<a name="usingboumlasacasetool"></a></h1>
<p>By Nico Brailovsky @ 2011-02-17</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really fancy CASE tools a lot, they are mostly fads, but I must admit it, using BoUML to work on a design the other day was a nice surprise. Not only the generated code didn&rsquo;t seem to be written by an trained monkey [1], it almost seemed to be usable with some tweaking. It even generated nice javadocs!</p>
<p>For this article I&rsquo;ll asume you have some experience with <a href="https://www.bouml.fr/">BoUML</a>. If you don&rsquo;t, apt-get it (it&rsquo;s available for Linux and Windows) then come back later, I&rsquo;ll wait.
<a href="https://www.bouml.fr/documentation.html">BoUML&rsquo;s manual</a> is quite good and includes a lot of screenshots, but if you&rsquo;re already experienced using it you may find this short checklist quicker to create a new project and use the code generation tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Languages &gt; C++ [&hellip;]; this will tell BoUML what language should generate. I haven&rsquo;t tried other than C++ but I&rsquo;ve heard they work fine.</li>
<li>Draw some nice UML to create a couple of classes (i.e. create a class view and a class diagram, then add some classes). Don&rsquo;t forget to add some relationships, so the generated code can be something more than &ldquo;class Foobar{};&rdquo;</li>
<li>Create a deployment view. Something like &ldquo;Foobar_deploy&rdquo;</li>
<li>Edit the class view, it should open a class view dialog. Select your new deployment view</li>
<li>Right click on each class and click &ldquo;Create source artifact&rdquo;. This&rsquo;ll create a new artifact under your deployment view</li>
<li>Almost done. In project &gt; Edit &gt; Edit Generation Settings go to &ldquo;Directory&rdquo; tab and select a root directory</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re now ready to right click on your class view and select &ldquo;Generate &gt; C++&rdquo;. Congratulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generating namespaces in C++ wasn&rsquo;t easy at first, and the manual may not be so clear about this one:
* Create a package. Move everything there (your deployment view, class view, etc).
* Edit the package. Under C++ complete each path and namespace name (?). For example, Foo, Foo Foo would generate your sources and headers under ./Foo, with namespace Foo.
* Repeat for as many namespaces as you want. You can have nested namespaces but you&rsquo;ll have to specify the full path and namespace name, i.e. Foo/Bar, Foo/Bar_CPP, Foo::Bar</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re going to use BoUML as a case tool, you&rsquo;ll want to name associations, use the multiplicity, create setters and getters and all the stuff you probably never did when documenting in UML to reach a <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Very,_Very_Well_Documented.aspx">minimum user-documentation wheight</a>. It seems these CASE tools haven&rsquo;t developed telepathy yet. Too bad.</p>

<h1>Vim Tip: Vigor<a name="vimtipvigor"></a></h1>
<p>By Nico Brailovsky @ 2011-02-15</p>
<p>Oh man. Just do a search on google images for Vim + Vigor. There are so many WTF images to choose from, I just can&rsquo;t decide. Apparently since Vim is the name of sexual enhancement drug or something like that, combining Vim and Vigor is a formula for fun.</p>
<p>Well, Vim and Vigor have a different meaning in Linux. Just do an apt-get install vigor, then run it. You&rsquo;ll have lots of fun with Vim&rsquo;s evil cousing, I promise.</p>

<h1>BoUML: A usable UML editor for Linux<a name="boumlausableumleditorforlinux"></a></h1>
<p>By Nico Brailovsky @ 2011-02-10</p>
<p>I bet you&rsquo;ve heard it before, some people actually document their projects. Crazy, I know. UML is the tool of choice this days, and a lot of bad applications exist to make your life misserable with half implementations of a half standard language, and random crashes sprinkled here and there to keep you alert and saving at all times (I&rsquo;m looking at you, Umbrello).</p>
<p>In Linux finding a decent UML application has been quite a difficult task, but after working with BoUML for quite some time I can say this tool, although not without its quircks, certainly meets my acceptance criteria [1].</p>
<p>BoUML, though a little bit unintuitive at first, is quite easy to use. Unlike most UML applications, this one workes closer to a CASE tool, so everything will have to be organized in packages. As a quickstart, create a class view and a class diagram inside that one, but you should really check the <a href="https://www.bouml.fr/">official manual</a>. It&rsquo;ll save you a lot of grief, trust me.</p>
<p>On the downside, BoUML is not quite so good for free-style UML, so making a collaboration diagram with network symbols is impossible. I can live with that, Dia is a nice complement for free-style diagrams (it does work&hellip; though the result is uglier than an the dog at the end of this post).</p>
<p>[1] WTF after so many years of really bad applications my &ldquo;acceptance criteria&rdquo; has fallen so low that &ldquo;stable&rdquo; almost equals &ldquo;good&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
