<h1>Know your history (at least in bash)<a name="knowyourhistoryatleastinbash"></a></h1>
<p>I always wonder why do you see so many people pressing up a bazillion times when trying to bring a command they recently typed. Just use ctrl+r and type part of the previous command, it'll save you many hours of pressing up.</p>

<p>in .bashrc I have an alias:
alias his='history | grep '
So I use
$ his ssh
to see all the ssh command I've entered.
It's a shorter list than history and more than [Ctrl]+r
Then !1234 to run a command again.</p>
