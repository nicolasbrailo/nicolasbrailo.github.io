<h1>Cool C++0X features XIV: Initializer lists<a name="coolc0xfeaturesxivinitializerlists"></a></h1>
<p>We talked last time about ranged fors and how they can simplify our life in C++0x. Now we are going to take a trip back to old C land. Remember when you could initialize your arrays like this:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">int v[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
</pre>
<p>C++0X brought a lot of changes to the world, and suddenly instead of int[] you were supposed to use vector, and with it your initializer didn't work anymore. Though luck. Try to compile this:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">#include &lt;vector&gt;
int main() {
    std::vector&lt;int&gt; v = {1,2,3,4};
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>If you did compile it with g++, you may have noticed an interesting error message:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">error: in C++98 &#x27;v&#x27; must be initialized by constructor, not by &#x27;{...}&#x27;
warning: extended initializer lists only available with -std=c++0x or -std=gnu++0x
</pre>
<p>That's interesting. Try to compile it with g++ again, but using C++0x instead of plain C++. Magic, now it works!</p>
<p>Initializers lists bring the best of C to C++ world (?) by letting you use initialize any object with an initializer. And I mean *any* object, not just vectors. For example, say you have a map (a map and a bunch of other stuff):</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">int main() {
    map&lt;string, vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; v = {
            { &quot;a&quot;, {1,2,3} },
            { &quot;b&quot;, {4,5,6} },
            { &quot;c&quot;, {7,8,9} }
        };
    cout &lt;&lt; v[&quot;b&quot;][1] &lt;&lt; &quot;n&quot;;
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>Yes, that works! Maps, vectors, pairs, and even your own custom objects, but we'll see that next time.</p>
