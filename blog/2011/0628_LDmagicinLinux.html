<h1>LD magic in Linux<a name="ldmagicinlinux"></a></h1>
<p>The linker is a magical beast which does all sort of crazy stuff with your binaries, without you even knowing it. Every Linux install has a linker living in the shadows, though seeing it in action is a rare supernatural event. There is an ancient tradition to communicate with the spirit of your linker. Not many know about this secret dark path and it&rsquo;s powers to annoy even the most experienced (L)user.</p>
<p>You may begin your journey with the following enchanting:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">export LD_DEBUG=help
</pre>
<p>If everything went fine nothing will seem to happen, yet if the gods of the console have heard you, the next time you try to run any binary at all you&rsquo;ll start to see the real magic. Try it, a simple &ldquo;ls&rdquo; will do the trick (don&rsquo;t use commands which are not binaries, like echo or export, these are &ldquo;hardcoded&rdquo; in bash, so to speak, and won&rsquo;t work since no runtime linking is necessary: they have already been linked when bash started!).</p>
<p>Read the help you just found. There is a lot of useful information there. Knowing the libs will give you an insight on the dependencies and the loading process of a binary. I have no idea what would be the use of knowing the files for each lib. The symbols and bindings are quite interesting, they remind me of an strace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;all&rdquo; is probably the best option to annoy a fellow programmer. Just set the env var and watch him go crazy.</p>
