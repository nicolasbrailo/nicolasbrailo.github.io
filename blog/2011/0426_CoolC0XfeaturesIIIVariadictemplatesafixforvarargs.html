<h1>Cool C++0X features III: Variadic templates, a fix for varargs<a name="coolc0xfeaturesiiivariadictemplatesafixforvarargs"></a></h1>
<p><a href="/blog/2011/0419_CoolC0XfeaturesIIVariadictemplatesWhat39swrongwithvarargs.html">Last time</a> we saw why a function with varargs may bring lots of problems. Then we saw how to solve it, but never explained why that last solution doesn&rsquo;t have the problems the varargs solution had, nor how does it work. Let&rsquo;s start by copying the solution here:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">// Stop condition
void println() {}
// General case
template &amp;lt;typename H, typename&hellip; T&amp;gt;
void println(H p, T&hellip; t)
{
   std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; p;
   println(t&hellip;);
}
int main() {
   println(&quot;Hola&quot;, &quot; mundo &quot;, 42, &#x27;n&#x27;;);
   return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>It certainly looks much better than the varargs function, even though some new strange syntax has been introduced. Keep in mind some <a href="/search/label/Templates">template-foo</a> is required, not only because of the syntax but because we&rsquo;ll be talking about functional programming too.</p>
<p>With all that intro (the last 2 articles were just an intro!) now we are in a good shape to ask what a variadic template really is. In its easiest form, it&rsquo;s just a list of template arguments, like this:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">template &amp;lt;typename&hellip; T&amp;gt; void foo(T&hellip; t) {}
</pre>
<p>That simple template can accept as many parameters as you need, of any type. This is much safer than a vararg because:
* Doesn&rsquo;t require the user to specify the number of args passed to foo, so it just can&rsquo;t get out of sync
* It&rsquo;s typesafe; since C++ templates are type-safe, variadic templates are type safe too. You won&rsquo;t be able to request an int where a char is required, you&rsquo;ll just get a compiler error.
* Compile time check: you get type safety just because this is all compiled code. If it doesn&rsquo;t compile, you get an error (albeit a little cryptic).
* <a href="/blog/2010/0407_PODtypesinC.html">POD types</a> support
* Better performance; small gain, but a gain indeed. Since this is all done in compile time there&rsquo;s no need to handle the stack dynamically, nor of having a loop getting the args. It&rsquo;s all known when you compile, thus the compiler can just optimize the hell out of everything</p>
<p>Pretty neat, huh? But how does it work? Variadic templates are actually very similar to how Haskell handles lists, you get all the arguments as a list of types in which you can either get the head or the tail. To do something useful, get the head and continue processing the tail recursively.</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">template &amp;lt;typename H, typename&hellip; T&amp;gt;
void do_something(H h, T&hellip; t)
{
    // Do something useful with h
    really_do_something(h);
    // Continue processing the tail
    do_something(t&hellip;);
}
</pre>
<p>Of course, you&rsquo;ll eventually need a condition to stop processing: (we&rsquo;ll explain the new syntax later)</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">void do_something()
{
    // Do nothing :)
}
</pre>
<p>When the list is completely processed the empty do_something function will be called. Easy, right? But it does have a lot of weird syntax. Let&rsquo;s see what each of those ellipses mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>When declaring typename&hellip; T you are saying &ldquo;here goes a list of types&rdquo;. That is, when you use ellipses after the typename (or class) declaration but before the name of the type, then you are expecting a list of types there.</li>
<li>When declaring T&hellip; t you are saying t is a list of objects with different type. That is, you declared T&hellip; as a type which holds a list of types, therefore t, of type T, is an instance of a list of objects, each of different type</li>
<li>When you write t&hellip;, you are saying &ldquo;expand the list of arguments&rdquo;. You declared t as a list of objects, but you have no way of accessing each of those objects, just to the list as a whole. When you write the name of the object followed by ellipses, you are saying expand these types and their instance for the called function</li>
</ul>
<p>With all that in mind, let&rsquo;s put together our typesafe printf:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">// Condition to stop processing
void println() {}
// Println receives a list of arguments. We don&amp;#x27;t know it&amp;#x27;s type nor
// how many there are, so we just get the head and expand the rest
template &amp;lt;typename H, typename&hellip; T&amp;gt;
void println(H p, T&hellip; t)
{
    // Do something useful with the head
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; p;
    // Expand the rest (pass it recursively to println)
    println(t&hellip;);
}
int main() {
    // See how it works even better than varargs?
   println(&quot;Hola&quot;, &quot; mundo &quot;, 42, &amp;#x27;n&amp;#x27;);
   return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>Next time, we&rsquo;ll see a more complex (and fun) example of variadic templates.</p>
