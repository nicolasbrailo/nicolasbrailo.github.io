<p>C++0X brings some very cool changes, and I wanted to start a series of posts regarding some of these changes, with a small explanation of each new feature (that I currently understand, at least), an example of its usage and why I think it's a cool thing. Notice these two may be mutually exclusive, some of these may just be cool but I wouldn't recommend using them on a day to day basis. An example of a very cool feature which I wouldn't normally use in a project is the one I want to write about today: variadic templates.</p>
<p>What's not to love about variadic templates? Its name implies (correctly) that it uses templates, and it also has a "variadic" thingy, which you can use to look smart since no one really knows what it means.</p>
<p>Templates themselves can quickly get complicated if used by unexperienced padawans in the art of martial C++, yet their hypnotic beauty draws every programmer to use them just like flies are drawn to fire. When used correctly they can produce very elegant code; if not for the template programmer, at least for the end user. Yet in all their power, templates in C++ have been lacking a fundamental aspect: a variable number of arguments.</p>
<p>There are ways to work around this limitation, like using a list of types paired with a template-paramlist-object. Sounds familiar? (I know it doesn't, don't worry). You could also generate N constructors, one overload for each parameter count. The drawback, exponential compile time (say, TR1). These are all hacks, which are in place only because there wasn't a safe way of passing a list of types associated with a list of arguments. This is over now with variadic templates in C++0X.</p>
<p>So, what kind of problem would variadic templates solve? Let's name a few:
* A typesafe varargs function (a function with a variable number of arguments)
* Easily create a template object which acts as a tuple
* An easier implementation of a reduce (inject) function</p>
<p>This entry is getting quite long so we'll start seeing these examples on the next post.</p>
