<h1>Running commands on Windows from Linux, through ssh<a name="runningcommandsonwindowsfromlinuxthroughssh"></a></h1>
<p>Running Windows is something I don't usually like (running of Windows is a different story) but having to run something on Windows command line interface is something I wouldn't wish even to my worst enemies. I was stuck in that situation, don't remember why, but I needed to run a command in a Windows machine, automatically, and I only had ssh (is there a better way of automating scripted tasks in Windows, remotely and without a GUI?). Well, this is what I came up with:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">ssh host cmd /c dir
</pre>
<p>Running that in a bash shell will show the directory listing of C: in machine "host". Ugly as hell, but it's a good way of kickstarting a batch script.</p>
