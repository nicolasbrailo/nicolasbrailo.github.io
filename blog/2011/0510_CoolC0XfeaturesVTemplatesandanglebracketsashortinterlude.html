<h1>Cool C++0X features V: Templates and angle brackets, a short interlude<a name="coolc0xfeaturesvtemplatesandanglebracketsashortinterlude"></a></h1>
<p>In the heart of C++ template metaprogramming and code obfuscation, lies the (ab)use of angle brackets. This seemingly innocent token can turn the most clean looking code into the mess that template-detractors like so much to complain about.</p>
<p>C++0x doesn't do much to clean up this mess, it's probably impossible, but it does offer a subtle feature to improve the legibility of C++ template code, a nifty little feature we have (inadvertently) used.</p>
<p>Up to C++0x, having two angle brackets together (&gt;&gt;) was parsed as the shift operator (like the one cout uses), meaning that if you had nested templates a lot of compiler errors ensued. C++0x corrects this, meaning that code which in C++ would be like this:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">Reduce&lt;Sum, Lst&lt;Num&lt;2&gt;, Lst&lt;Num&lt;4&gt;, Lst&lt;Num&lt;6&gt;, Lst&lt; Num&lt;8&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</pre>
<p>Can now be written like this:</p>
<pre lang="c++" style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid red;">Reduce&lt;Sum, Lst&lt;Num&lt;2&gt;, Lst&lt;Num&lt;4&gt;, Lst&lt;Num&lt;6&gt;, Lst&lt; Num&lt;8&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
<p>Aaand, back to the normal schedule...</p>
