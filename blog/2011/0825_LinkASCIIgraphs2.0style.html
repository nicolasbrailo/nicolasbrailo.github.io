<p>Every once in a while you need to draw a graph to quickly convey some information, and you don&rsquo;t want all the hassle of opening paint, drawing whatever you want, exporting it as png, and all that stuff. Sometimes it&rsquo;s just easier to do it as ASCII art, only you don&rsquo;t want to spend hours carefully aligning pipes and dashes.
