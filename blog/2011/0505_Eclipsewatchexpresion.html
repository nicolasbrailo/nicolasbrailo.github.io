<h1>Eclipse watch expresion<a name="eclipsewatchexpresion"></a></h1>
<p>So, now that I'm working for the dark side: did you know Eclipse had watch expressions which shows a variable's value on real time? I bet you did, gdb has that too. Did you know a watch expression can evaluate a method call too? Neat, huh? Well, gdb has that too.</p>
<p>Anyway, someone on the team was having weird issues. A switch would jump to unexpected places. The state of an object would change between method calls. WTF?</p>
<p>After some debugging then it downed on me: I once (a long time before this strange behavior) saw this person using watch expressions to evaluate a method's return value. You now have enough information to troubleshoot this problem.</p>
<p>Ready? It's easy. A watch expression of a method call has the ability to alter an object's status. So, if you have something like this:</p>
<pre lang="c++"><code lang="c++">
class Foo {
   int a;
   public:
   Foo() : a(0) {}
   void sumar(){ a++; }
};
int main() {
   Foo bar;
   /<em> do something </em>/
   return 42;
}
</code></pre>
<p>and then add a watch expression over bar.sumar(), then bar.a's value will be undefined for the execution of this program. Nice!</p>
